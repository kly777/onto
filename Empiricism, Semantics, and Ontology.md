### 1. The problem of abstract entities 抽象实体的问题

Empiricists are in general rather suspicious with respect to any kind of abstract entities like properties, classes, relations, numbers, propositions, etc. They usually feel much more in sympathy with nominalists than with realists (in the medieval sense). As far as possible they try to avoid any reference to abstract entities and to restrict themselves to what is sometimes called a nominalistic language, i.e., one not containing such references. However, within certain scientific contexts it seems hardly possible to avoid them. In the case of mathematics some empiricists try to find a way out by treating the whole of mathematics as a mere calculus, a formal system for which no interpretation is given, or can be given. Accordingly, the mathematician is said to speak not about numbers, functions and infinite classes but merely about meaningless symbols and formulas manipulated according to given formal rules. In physics it is more difficult to shun the suspected entities because the language of physics serves for the communication of reports and predictions and hence cannot be taken as a mere calculus. A physicist who is suspicious of abstract entities may perhaps try to declare a certain part of the language of physics as uninterpreted and uninterpretable, that part which refers to real numbers as space-time coordinates or as values of physical magnitudes, to functions, limits, etc. More probably he will just speak about all these things like anybody else but with an uneasy conscience, like a man who in his everyday life does with qualms many things which are not in accord with the high moral principles he professes on Sundays. Recently the problem of abstract entities has arisen again in connection with semantics, the theory of meaning and truth. Some semanticists say that certain expressions designate certain entities, and among these designated entities they include not only concrete material things but also abstract entities e.g., properties as designated by predicates and propositions as designated by sentences.[1](#1) Others object strongly to this procedure as violating the basic principles of empiricism and leading back to a metaphysical ontology of the Platonic kind.  
经验主义者通常对任何类型的抽象实体（如属性、类、关系、数字、命题等）都持怀疑态度。他们通常更同情唯名论者，而不是现实主义者（在中世纪意义上）。他们尽可能避免对抽象实体的任何引用，并将自己限制在有时被称为唯名性语言的语言中，即不包含此类引用的语言。然而，在某些科学背景下，似乎几乎不可能避免它们。就数学而言，一些经验主义者试图通过将整个数学视为纯粹的微积分来找到出路，一个没有给出或可以给出解释的形式系统。因此，据说数学家不谈论数字、函数和无限类，而只是根据给定的形式规则纵的无意义符号和公式。在物理学中，要避开可疑的实体更加困难，因为物理学的语言是用来传达报告和预测的，因此不能仅仅被视为微积分。一个对抽象实体持怀疑态度的物理学家可能会试图将物理学语言的某一部分宣布为不可解释和不可解释的，该部分将实数称为时空坐标或物理大小值，称为函数、极限等。更有可能的是，他会像其他人一样谈论所有这些事情，但心里很不安，就像一个在日常生活中顾虑地做许多不符合他在星期天所宣称的高尚道德原则的事情的人一样。最近，抽象实体的问题再次出现，与语义学、意义和真理理论有关。一些语义学家说，某些表达指定了某些实体，在这些指定的实体中，它们不仅包括具体的物质事物，还包括抽象的实体，例如，由谓词指定的属性和由句子指定的命题。其他人则强烈反对这一程序，认为它违反了经验主义的基本原则，并导致了柏拉图式的形而上学本体论。

It is the purpose of this article to clarify this controversial issue. The nature and implications of the acceptance of a language referring to abstract entities will first be discussed in general; it will be shown that using such a language does not imply embracing a Platonic ontology but is perfectly compatible with empiricism and strictly scientific thinking. Then the special question of the role of abstract entities in semantics will be discussed. It is hoped that the clarification of the issue will be useful to those who would like to accept abstract entities in their work in mathematics, physics, semantics, or any other field; it may help them to overcome nominalistic scruples.  
本文的目的是澄清这个有争议的问题。首先将一般性地讨论接受引用抽象实体的语言的性质和影响;我们将表明，使用这样的语言并不意味着接受柏拉图式的本体论，而是与经验主义和严格的科学思维完全兼容。然后，将讨论抽象实体在语义中的作用的特殊问题。希望这个问题的澄清对那些希望在数学、物理学、语义学或任何其他领域的工作中接受抽象实体的人有用;它可能会帮助他们克服唯名主义的顾虑。

### 2. Linguistic frameworks 语言框架

Are there properties classes, numbers, propositions? In order to understand more clearly the nature of these and related problems, it is above all necessary to recognize a fundamental distinction between two kinds of questions concerning the existence or reality of entities. If someone wishes to speak in his language about a new kind of entities, he has to introduce a system of new ways of speaking, subject to new rules; we shall call this procedure the construction of a linguistic _framework_ for the new entities in question. And now we must distinguish two kinds of questions of existence: first, questions of the existence of certain entities of the new kind _within the framework_; we call them _internal questions_; and second, questions concerning the existence or reality _of the system of entities as a whole_, called _external questions_. Internal questions and possible answers to them are formulated with the help of the new forms of expressions. The answers may be found either by purely logical methods or by empirical methods, depending upon whether the framework is a logical or a factual one. An external question is of a problematic character which is in need of closer examination.  
有属性类、数字、命题吗？为了更清楚地理解这些问题和相关问题的本质，首先需要认识到关于实体的存在或现实的两种问题之间的根本区别。如果有人想用他的语言谈论一种新的实体，他必须引入一个新的说话方式系统，但要遵守新的规则;我们将此过程称为为所讨论的新实体构建语言框架。现在我们必须区分两种存在问题：第一，框架内某些新实体的存在问题;我们称它们为内部问题;第二种是关于整个实体系统的存在或现实的问题，称为外部问题。内部问题和可能的答案是在新的表达形式的帮助下制定的。答案可以通过纯粹的逻辑方法或经验方法找到，这取决于框架是逻辑的还是事实的。一个外部问题具有问题性质，需要更仔细地研究。

_The world of things_. Let us consider as an example the simplest kind of entities dealt with in the everyday language: the spatio-temporally ordered system of observable things and events. Once we have accepted the thing language with its framework for things, we can raise and answer internal questions, e.g., "Is there a white piece of paper on my desk?" "Did King Arthur actually live?", "Are unicorns and centaurs real or merely imaginary?" and the like. These questions are to be answered by empirical investigations. Results of observations are evaluated according to certain rules as confirming or disconfirming evidence for possible answers. (This evaluation is usually carried out, of course, as a matter of habit rather than a deliberate, rational procedure. But it is possible, in a rational reconstruction, to lay down explicit rules for the evaluation. This is one of the main tasks of a pure, as distinguished from a psychological, epistemology.) The concept of reality occurring in these internal questions is an empirical scientific non-metaphysical concept. To recognize something as a real thing or event means to succeed in incorporating it into the system of things at a particular space-time position so that it fits together with the other things as real, according to the rules of the framework.  
万物世界。让我们以日常语言中处理的最简单的实体为例：可观察事物和事件的时空有序系统。一旦我们接受了事物语言及其事物框架，我们就可以提出和回答内部问题，例如，“我的桌子上有一张白纸吗？“亚瑟王真的活过吗？”，“独角兽和半人马是真的还是只是虚构的？”等等。这些问题将通过实证调查来回答。观察结果根据某些规则进行评估，以确认或否定可能答案的证据。（当然，这种评估通常是作为习惯问题进行的，而不是一个深思熟虑的、理性的程序。但是，在理性的重建中，有可能为评估制定明确的规则。这是纯粹认识论的主要任务之一，与心理学认识论不同。在这些内部问题中出现的现实概念是一个实证科学的非形而上学的概念。将某物识别为真实的事物或事件意味着根据框架的规则，成功地将其纳入特定时空位置的事物系统中，以便它与其他事物一起成为真实的事物。

From these questions we must distinguish the external question of the reality of the thing world itself. In contrast to the former questions, this question is raised neither by the man in the street nor by scientists, but only by philosophers. Realists give an affirmative answer, subjective idealists a negative one, and the controversy goes on for centuries without ever being solved. And it cannot be solved because it is framed in a wrong way. To be real in the scientific sense means to be an element of the system; hence this concept cannot be meaningfully applied to the system itself. Those who raise the question of the reality of the thing world itself have perhaps in mind not a theoretical question as their formulation seems to suggest, but rather a practical question, a matter of a practical decision concerning the structure of our language. We have to make the choice whether or not to accept and use the forms of expression in the framework in question.  
从这些问题中，我们必须区分事物世界本身的现实性的外部问题。与前者问题相反，这个问题既不是由街上的人提出的，也不是由科学家提出的，而只是由哲学家提出的。现实主义者给出肯定的答案，主观理想主义者给出否定的答案，争论持续了几个世纪，从未得到解决。而且它无法解决，因为它的框架是错误的。在科学意义上，真实意味着成为系统的一个元素;因此，这个概念不能有意义地应用于系统本身。那些提出事物世界本身的现实性问题的人，也许不是他们的表述所暗示的理论问题，而是一个实际问题，一个关于我们语言结构的实际决定问题。我们必须选择是否接受和使用所讨论框架中的表达形式。

In the case of this particular example, there is usually no deliberate choice because we all have accepted the thing language early in our lives as a matter of course. Nevertheless, we may regard it as a matter of decision in this sense: we are free to choose to continue using the thing language or not; in the latter case we could restrict ourselves to a language of sense data and other "phenomenal" entities, or construct an alternative to the customary thing language with another structure, or, finally, we could refrain from speaking. If someone decides to accept the thing language, there is no objection against saying that he has accepted the world of things. But this must not be interpreted as if it meant his acceptance of a _belief_ in the reality of the thing world; there is no such belief or assertion or assumption, because it is not a theoretical question. To accept the thing world means nothing more than to accept a certain form of language, in other words, to accept rules for forming statements and for testing accepting or rejecting them. The acceptance of the thing language leads on the basis of observations made, also to the acceptance, belief, and assertion of certain statements. But the thesis of the reality of the thing world cannot be among these statements, because it cannot be formulated in the thing language or, it seems, in any other theoretical language.  
在这个特定的例子中，通常没有刻意的选择，因为我们都在生命的早期就理所当然地接受了事物语言。然而，从这个意义上说，我们可以将其视为一个决定问题：我们可以自由选择是否继续使用事物语言;在后一种情况下，我们可以将自己限制在一种由感官数据和其他“现象”实体组成的语言中，或者用另一种结构构建一种替代习惯事物的语言，或者，最后，我们可以不说话。如果某人决定接受事物语言，那么说他已经接受了事物的世界是没有异议的。但这绝不能被解释为意味着他接受了对事物世界现实的信仰;没有这样的信念、断言或假设，因为它不是一个理论问题。接受事物世界的含义无非是接受某种形式的语言，换句话说，接受形成陈述和测试接受或拒绝它们的规则。对事物语言的接受是基于对观察的接受，也导致了对某些陈述的接受、相信和断言。但是，事物世界的现实性论点不能出现在这些陈述中，因为它不能用事物语言来表述，或者似乎不能用任何其他理论语言来表述。

The decision of accepting the thing language, although itself not of a cognitive nature, will nevertheless usually be influenced by theoretical knowledge, just like any other deliberate decision concerning the acceptance of linguistic or other rules. The purposes for which the language is intended to be used, for instance, the purpose of communicating factual knowledge, will determine which factors are relevant for the decision. The efficiency, fruitfulness, and simplicity of the use of the thing language may be among the decisive factors. And the questions concerning these qualities are indeed of a theoretical nature. But these questions cannot be identified with the question of realism. They are not yes-no questions but questions of degree. The thing language in the customary form works indeed with a high degree of efficiency for most purposes of everyday life. This is a matter of fact, based upon the content of our experiences. However, it would be wrong to describe this situation by saying: "The fact of the efficiency of the thing language is confirming evidence for the reality of the thing world; we should rather say instead: "This fact makes it advisable to accept the thing language."  
接受事物语言的决定，虽然本身不具有认知性质，但通常会受到理论知识的影响，就像任何其他关于接受语言或其他规则的深思熟虑的决定一样。该语言的预期使用目的，例如，传达事实知识的目的，将决定哪些因素与决定相关。使用事物语言的效率、成果和简单性可能是决定性因素之一。而关于这些品质的问题确实是理论性质的。但这些问题不能与现实主义问题相提并论。它们不是是-否的问题，而是程度的问题。习惯形式的事物语言确实在日常生活的大多数目的中以很高的效率工作。事实上，这是一个基于我们经验内容的问题。然而，这样描述这种情况是错误的：“事物语言的效率事实正在证实事物世界真实性的证据;我们应该说：“这个事实使得接受事物语言是可取的。

_The system of numbers_. As an example of a system which is of a logical rather than a factual nature let us take the system of natural numbers. The framework for this system is constructed by introducing into the language new expressions with suitable rules: (1) numerals like "five" and sentence forms like "there are five books on the table"; (2) the general term "number" for the new entities, and sentence forms like "five is a number"; (3) expressions for properties of numbers (e.g. "odd," "prime"), relations (e.g., "greater than") and functions (e.g. "plus"), and sentence forms like "two plus three is five"; (4) numerical variables ("_m_," "_n_," etc.) and quantifiers for universal sentences ("for every _n_ . . . ) and existential sentences ("there is an _n_ such that . . .") with the customary deductive rules.  
数字系统。作为一个具有逻辑性质而不是事实性质的系统的例子，让我们以自然数系统为例。该系统的框架是通过在语言中引入具有适当规则的新表达方式来构建的：（1） 像 “five” 这样的数字和像 “there are five books on the table” 这样的句子形式;（2） 新实体的通用术语“数字”，以及像“五是一个数字”这样的句子形式;（3） 数字属性（例如“奇数”、“素数”）、关系（例如“大于”）和函数（例如“加”）以及句子形式（如“二加三等于五”）的表达式;（4） 数字变量（“m”、“n”等）和通用句子的量词（“for every n . . .和存在句（“有一个 n 这样的 . . .”）与惯用的演绎规则。

Here again there are internal questions, e.g., "Is there a prime number greater than a hundred?" Here however the answers are found not by empirical investigation based on observations but by logical analysis based on the rules for the new expressions. Therefore the answers are here analytic, i.e., logically true.  
这里又有一些内部问题，例如，“有没有大于 100 的素数？然而，在这里，答案不是通过基于观察的实证调查找到的，而是通过基于新表达规则的逻辑分析找到的。因此，这里的答案是分析性的，即逻辑上的正确。

What is now the nature of the philosophical question concerning the existence or reality of numbers? To begin with, there is the internal question which together with the affirmative answer, can be formulated in the new terms, say by "There are numbers" or, more explicitly, "There is an _n_ such that _n_ is a number." This statement follows from the analytic statement "five is a number" and is therefore itself analytic. Moreover, it is rather trivial (in contradistinction to a statement like "There is a prime number greater than a million which is likewise analytic but far from trivial), because it does not say more than that the new system is not empty; but this is immediately seen from the rule which states that words like "five" are substitutable for the new variables. Therefore nobody who meant the question "Are there numbers?" in the internal sense would either assert or even seriously consider a negative answer. This makes it plausible to assume that those philosophers who treat the question of the existence of numbers as a serious philosophical problem and offer lengthy arguments on either side, do not have in mind the internal question. And indeed, if we were to ask them: "Do you mean the question as to whether the framework of numbers, _if_ we were to accept it, would be found to be empty or not?" they would probably reply: "Not at all; we mean a question prior to the acceptance of the new framework." They might try to explain what they mean by saying that it is a question of the ontological status of numbers; the question whether or not numbers have a certain metaphysical characteristic called reality (but a kind of ideal reality, different from the material reality of the thing world) or subsistence or status of "independent entities." Unfortunately, these philosophers have so far not given a formulation of their question in terms of the common scientific language. Therefore our judgment must be that they have not succeeded in giving to the external question and to the possible answers any cognitive content. Unless and until they supply a clear cognitive interpretation, we are justified in our suspicion that their question is a pseudo-question, that is, one disguised in the form of a theoretical question while in fact it is a non-theoretical; in the present case it is the practical problem whether or not to incorporate into the language the new linguistic forms which constitute the framework of numbers.  
现在关于数字的存在或现实的哲学问题的本质是什么？首先，有一个内部问题，它与肯定的回答一起可以用新术语来表述，比如“有数字”，或者更明确地说，“有一个 n，使得 n 是一个数字”。这个陈述遵循分析语句“五是一个数字”，因此本身就是分析的。此外，它相当微不足道（与“有一个大于一百万的素数同样是分析性的，但绝非微不足道”这样的陈述相反，因为它只说明了新系统不是空的;但这可以从规则中立即看出，该规则规定像 “five” 这样的词可以替代新变量。因此，在内部意义上提出“有数字吗”这个问题的人都不会断言，甚至不会认真考虑一个否定的答案。这使得可以合理地假设，那些将数字存在问题视为一个严肃的哲学问题并为任何一方提供冗长论证的哲学家，并没有考虑内部问题。事实上，如果我们问他们：“你的意思是，如果我们接受数字框架，它是否会被发现是空的吗？”他们可能会回答：“一点也不;我们指的是接受新框架之前的问题。他们可能会试图解释他们的意思，说这是一个数字的本体论地位的问题;数字是否具有某种称为现实的形而上学特征（但是一种理想现实，不同于事物世界的物质现实）或“独立实体”的存在或地位的问题。不幸的是，这些哲学家到目前为止还没有用通用的科学语言来表述他们的问题。因此，我们的判断必须是他们没有成功地为外部问题和可能的答案提供任何认知内容。除非他们提供明确的认知解释，否则我们有理由怀疑他们的问题是伪问题，也就是说，一个伪装成理论问题的问题，而实际上是一个非理论的问题;在目前的情况下，是否将构成数字框架的新语言形式纳入语言是一个实际问题。

_The system of propositions_. New variables, "p," "q," etc., are introduced with a role to the effect that any (declarative) sentence may be substituted for a variable of this kind; this includes, in addition to the sentences of the original thing language, also all general sentences with variables of any kind which may have been introduced into the language. Further, the general term "proposition" is introduced. "p is a proposition" may be defined by "p or not p" (or by any other sentence form yielding only analytic sentences) . Therefore every sentence of the form ". . . is a proposition" (where any sentence may stand in the place of the dots) is analytic. This holds, for example, for the sentence:  
命题系统。引入了新的变量 “p”、“q” 等，其作用是任何（陈述性的）句子都可以代替此类变量;除了原始事物语言的句子外，还包括可能已引入语言的所有带有任何类型变量的通用句子。此外，还引入了通用术语“命题”。“p is a proposition” 可以用 “p or not p” 来定义 （或者用任何其他只产生分析句的句子形式） 来定义。因此，“. . .是一个命题“（其中任何句子都可以代替点）是分析性的。例如，对于句子来说，这句话是成立的：

> (a) Chicago is large is a proposition.  
> （a） 芝加哥很大是一个命题。

(We disregard here the fact that the rules of English grammar require not a sentence but a that-clause as the subject of another sentence; accordingly instead of (a) we should have to say "That Chicago is large is a proposition.") Predicates may be admitted whose argument expressions are sentences; these predicates may be either extensional (e.g. the customary truth-functional connectives) or not (e.g. modal predicates like "possible," "necessary," etc.). With the help of the new variables, general sentences may be formed, e.g.,  
（我们在这里忽略了这样一个事实，即英语语法规则要求不是一个句子，而是 that-clause 作为另一个句子的主语;因此，我们应该说“That Chicago is large is a proposition”，而不是 （a）。可以接受其参数表达式为句子的谓词;这些谓词可以是外延的（例如，惯用的真值-功能连接词），也可以是非外延的（例如，情态谓词，如“可能”、“必要”等）。在新变量的帮助下，可以形成一般句子，例如，

> (b) "For every _p_, either _p_ or not-_p_."  
> (c) "There is a _p_ such that _p_ is not necessary and not-_p_ is not necessary."  
> (d) "There is a _p_ such that _p_ is a proposition."  
> （b） “对于每个 p，要么是 p 要么不是 p。” （c） “存在一个 p，使得 p 不是必需的，非 p 也不是必需的。” （d） “存在一个 p，使得 p 是一个命题。”

(c) and (d) are internal assertions of existence. The statement "There are propositions" may be meant in the sense of (d); in this case it is analytic (since it follows from (a)) and even trivial. If, however, the statement is meant in an external sense, then it is non-cognitive.  
（c） 和 （d） 是存在的内部断言。“There are propositions” 这句话的含义可以是 （d）;在这种情况下，它是分析性的（因为它遵循 （a）），甚至是微不足道的。然而，如果这个陈述是在外部意义上表达的，那么它就是非认知的。

It is important to notice that the system of rules for the linguistic expressions of the propositional framework (of which only a few rules have here been briefly indicated) is sufficient for the introduction of the framework. Any further explanations as to the nature of the propositions (i.e., the elements of the system indicated, the values of the variables "_p_," "_q_," etc.) are theoretically unnecessary because, if correct, they follow from the rules. For example, are propositions mental events (as in Russell's theory)? A look at the rules shows us that they are not, because otherwise existential statements would be of the form: "If the mental state of the person in question fulfills such and such conditions, then there is a _p_ such that . . . ." The fact that no references to mental conditions occur in existential statements (like (c), (d), etc.) shows that propositions are not mental entities. Further, a statement of the existence of linguistic entities (e.g., expressions, classes of expressions, etc.) must contain a reference to a language. The fact that no such reference occurs in the existential statements here, shows that propositions are not linguistic entities. The fact that in these statements no reference to a subject (an observer or knower) occurs (nothing like: "There is a _p_ which is necessary for Mr. X."), shows that the propositions (and their properties, like necessity, etc.) are not subjective. Although characterizations of these or similar kinds are, strictly speaking, unnecessary, they may nevertheless be practically useful. If they are given, they should be understood, not as ingredient parts of the system, but merely as marginal notes with the purpose of supplying to the reader helpful hints or convenient pictorial associations which may make his learning of the use of the expressions easier than the bare system of the rules would do. Such a characterization is analogous to an extra-systematic explanation which a physicist sometimes gives to the beginner. He might, for example, tell him to imagine the atoms of a gas as small balls rushing around with great speed, or the electromagnetic field and its oscillations as quasi-elastic tensions and vibrations in an ether. In fact, however, all that can accurately be said about atoms or the field is implicitly contained in the physical laws of the theories in question.[2](#2)  
重要的是要注意，命题框架的语言表达规则系统（这里只简要指出了其中的几个规则）足以引入该框架。关于命题性质的任何进一步解释（即，所指示的系统元素、变量 “p”、“q” 等的值）在理论上都是不必要的，因为如果正确，它们遵循规则。例如，命题是心理事件吗（如罗素的理论）？看一下这些规则，我们就会发现它们不是，因为否则存在主义陈述的形式将是：“如果这个人的精神状态满足这样那样的条件，那么就有一个 p，这样......在存在论陈述中没有提到心理状况的事实（如 （c）、（d） 等）表明命题不是心理实体。此外，语言实体（例如，表达式、表达式类等）存在的声明必须包含对语言的引用。事实上，在存在论陈述中没有出现这样的指涉，这表明命题不是语言实体。在这些陈述中没有提到主语（观察者或知识者）的事实（就像：“有一个 p 对 X 先生来说是必要的”），这表明命题（及其属性，如必要性等）不是主观的。尽管严格来说，这些或类似类型的特征是不必要的，但它们仍然可能实际上是有用的。如果给出了它们，那么它们应该被理解，而不是作为系统的组成部分，而只是作为旁注，目的是为读者提供有用的提示或方便的图片联想，这可能使他学习这些表达的用法比简单的规则系统更容易。这样的描述类似于物理学家有时给初学者的超系统解释。例如，他可能会告诉他把气体的原子想象成以极快的速度冲来跑去的小球，或者把电磁场及其振荡想象成以太中的准弹性张力和振动。然而，事实上，所有关于原子或场的准确说法都隐含在所讨论的理论的物理定律中 2。

_The system of thing properties_ The thing language contains words like "red," "hard," "stone," "house," etc., which we used for describing what things are like. Now we may introduce new variables, say "_f_," "_g_," etc., for which those words are substitutable and furthermore the general term "property." New rules are laid down which admit sentences like "Red is a property," "Red is a color," "These two pieces of paper have at least one color in common" (i.e., "There is an _f_ such that _f_ is a color, and . . ."). The last sentence is an internal assertion. It is an empirical, factual nature. However, the external statement, the philosophical statement of the reality of properties -- a special case of the thesis of the reality of universals -- is devoid of cognitive content.  
事物属性系统 事物语言包含诸如 “red”、“hard”、“stone”、“house” 等词，我们用这些词来描述事物是什么样子的。现在我们可以引入新的变量，比如 “f”、“g” 等，这些词是可以替换的，此外，通用术语 “property”。制定了新的规则，允许诸如“红色是一种属性”、“红色是一种颜色”、“这两张纸至少有一种共同的颜色”（即“有一个 f 使得 f 是一种颜色，并且......最后一句是内部断言。它是一种实证的、事实的性质。然而，外部陈述，对属性现实的哲学陈述——普遍性现实论的一个特例——是缺乏认知内容。

_The system of integers and rational numbers_. Into a language containing the framework of natural numbers we may introduce first the (positive and negative) integers as relations among natural numbers and then the rational numbers as relations among integers. This involves introducing new types of variables, expressions substitutable for them, and the general terms "integer" and "rational number."  
整数和有理数的系统。在包含自然数框架的语言中，我们可以首先引入（正和负）整数作为自然数之间的关系，然后引入有理数作为整数之间的关系。这涉及引入新类型的变量、可替代它们的表达式以及通用术语 “整数” 和 “有理数”。

_The system of real numbers._ On the basis of the rational numbers, the real numbers may be introduced as classes of a special kind (segments) of rational numbers (according to the method developed by Dedekind and Frege). Here again a new type of variables is introduced, expressions substitutable for them (e.g., "√2" \[square root of 2\]), and the general term "real number."  
实数系统。在有理数的基础上，实数可以作为有理数的特殊类型（段）的类引入（根据 Dedekind 和 Frege 开发的方法）。这里再次引入了一种新的变量类型，可以用表达式代替它们（例如，“√2” \[2 的平方根\]），以及通用术语“实数”。

_The spatio-temporal coordinate system for physics._ The new entities are the space-time points. Each is an ordered quadruple of four real numbers, called its coordinates, consisting of three spatial and one temporal coordinates. The physical state of a spatio-temporal point or region is described either with the help of qualitative predicates (e.g., "hot") or by ascribing numbers as values of a physical magnitude (e.g., mass, temperature, and the like). The step from the system of things (which does not contain space-time points but only extended objects with spatial and temporal relations between them) to the physical coordinate system is again a matter of decision. Our choice of certain features, although itself not theoretical, is suggested by theoretical knowledge, either logical or factual. For example, the choice of real numbers rather than rational numbers or integers as coordinates is not much influenced by the facts of experience but mainly due to considerations of mathematical simplicity. The restriction to rational coordinates would not be in conflict with any experimental knowledge we have, because the result of any measurement is a rational number. However, it would prevent the use of ordinary geometry (which says, e.g., that the diagonal of a square with the side I has the irrational value √2) and thus lead to great complications. On the other hand, the decision to use three rather than two or four spatial coordinates is strongly suggested, but still not forced upon us, by the result of common observations. If certain events allegedly observed in spiritualistic seances, e.g., a ball moving out of a sealed box, were confirmed beyond any reasonable doubt, it might seem advisable to use four spatial coordinates. Internal questions are here, in general, empirical questions to be answered by empirical investigations. On the other hand, the external questions of the reality of physical space and physical time are pseudo-questions. A question like: "Are there (really) space-time points?" is ambiguous. It may be meant as an internal question; then the affirmative answer is, of course, analytic and trivial. Or it may be meant in the external sense: "Shall we introduce such and such forms into our language?"; in this case it is not a theoretical but a practical question, a matter of decision rather than assertion, and hence the proposed formulation would be misleading. Or finally, it may be meant in the following sense: "Are our experiences such that the use of the linguistic forms in question will be expedient and fruitful?" This is a theoretical question of a factual, empirical nature. But it concerns a matter of degree; therefore a formulation in the form "real or not?" would be inadequate.  
物理学的时空坐标系。新实体是时空点。每个都是四个实数的有序四元组，称为其坐标，由三个空间坐标和一个时间坐标组成。时空点或区域的物理状态可以借助定性谓词（例如，“热”）来描述，也可以通过将数字归类为物理量级的值（例如，质量、温度等）来描述。从事物系统（不包含时空点，而只包含具有空间和时间关系的扩展对象）到物理坐标系的步骤又是一个决定问题。我们对某些特征的选择，虽然本身不是理论性的，但是由理论知识建议的，无论是逻辑的还是事实的。例如，选择实数而不是有理数或整数作为坐标，这在很大程度上受到经验事实的影响，而主要是由于数学简单性的考虑。对有理坐标的限制不会与我们所拥有的任何实验知识相冲突，因为任何测量的结果都是一个有理数。然而，它会阻止使用普通几何（例如，说边为 I 的正方形的对角线具有无理值 √2），从而导致非常复杂。另一方面，根据常见的观察结果，强烈建议我们决定使用三个而不是两个或四个空间坐标，但仍然不是强加给我们的。如果据称在招魂术降神会中观察到的某些事件，例如，一个球从密封的盒子中移出，在没有任何合理怀疑的情况下得到证实，那么使用四个空间坐标似乎是可取的。一般来说，内部问题在这里，是通过实证调查来回答的实证问题。另一方面，物理空间和物理时间的现实的外部问题是伪问题。像这样的问题是模棱两可的：“有（真的）时空点吗？它可能是一个内部问题;那么肯定的答案当然是分析和琐碎的。或者它可能在外部意义上意味着：“我们应该将这样那样的形式引入我们的语言吗？在这种情况下，这不是一个理论问题，而是一个实践问题，是一个决定而不是断言的问题，因此拟议的表述将具有误导性。或者最后，它的含义可能是这样的：“我们的经验是否使使用所讨论的语言形式将是权宜之计和富有成效的？这是一个具有事实、实证性质的理论问题。但这涉及到一个程度的问题;因此，以 “Real or Not？” 的形式表述是不够的。

### 3. What does acceptance of a kind of entities mean? 接受一类实体是什么意思？

Let us now summarize the essential characteristics of situations involving the introduction of a new kind of entities, characteristics which are common to the various examples outlined above.  
现在让我们总结一下涉及引入一种新实体的情况的基本特征，这些特征是上述各种示例的共同特征。

The acceptance of a new kind of entities is represented in the language by the introduction of a framework of new forms of expressions to be used according to a new set of rules. There may be new names for particular entities of the kind in question; but some such names may already occur in the language before the introduction of the new framework. (Thus, for example, the thing language contains certainly words of the type of "blue" and "house" before the framework of properties is introduced; and it may contain words like "ten" in sentences of the form "I have ten fingers" before the framework of numbers is introduced.) The latter fact shows that the occurrence of constants of the type in question -- regarded as names of entities of the new kind after the new framework is introduced -- is not a sure sign of the acceptance of the new kind of entities. Therefore the introduction of such constants is not to be regarded as an essential step in the introduction of the framework. The two essential steps are rather the following. First, the introduction of a general term, a predicate of higher level, for the new kind of entities, permitting us to say for any particular entity that it belongs to this kind (e.g., "Red is a _property_," "Five is a _number_"). Second, the introduction of variables of the new type. The new entities are values of these variables; the constants (and the closed compound expressions, if any) are substitutable for the variables.[3](#3) With the help of the variables, general sentences concerning the new entities can be formulated.
在语言中，对一种新实体的接受表现为引入根据一组新规则使用的新表达形式框架。相关类型的特定实体可能会有新名称;但是，在引入新框架之前，语言中可能已经出现了一些这样的名称。（因此，例如，在引入属性框架之前，事物语言肯定包含“blue”和“house”类型的单词;在引入数字框架之前，它可能包含“I have ten fingers”形式的句子中的“ten”之类的单词。后一个事实表明，所讨论的常量的出现 -- 在引入新框架后被视为新类型实体的名称 -- 并不是接受新类型实体的确定标志。因此，引入此类常数不应被视为引入框架的必要步骤。两个基本步骤如下。首先，为新型实体引入一个通用术语，一个更高级别的谓词，允许我们对任何特定实体说它属于这种实体（例如，“红色是一种属性”，“五是一个数字”）。第二，引入新类型的变量。新实体是这些变量的值;常数（和封闭复合表达式，如果有的话）可以替代变量。3 在变量的帮助下，可以制定有关新实体的一般句子。

After the new forms are introduced into the language, it is possible to formulate with their help internal questions and possible answers to them. A question of this kind may be either empirical or logical; accordingly a true answer is either factually true or analytic.
在将新形式引入语言后，可以在他们的帮助下制定内部问题和可能的答案。这类问题可能是经验性的或逻辑性的;因此，一个真实的答案要么是事实的真实，要么是分析的。

From the internal questions we must clearly distinguish external questions, i.e., philosophical questions concerning the existence or reality of the total system of the new entities. Many philosophers regard a question of this kind as an ontological question which must be raised and answered before the introduction of the new language forms. The latter introduction, they believe, is legitimate only if it can be justified by an ontological insight supplying an affirmative answer to the question of reality. In contrast to this view, we take the position that the introduction of the new ways of speaking does not need any theoretical justification because it does not imply any assertion of reality. We may still speak (and have done so) of the "acceptance of the new entities" since this form of speech is customary; but one must keep in mind that this phrase does not mean for us anything more than acceptance of the new framework, i.e., of the new linguistic forms. Above all, it must not be interpreted as referring to an assumption, belief, or assertion of "the reality of the entities." There is no such assertion. An alleged statement of the reality of the system of entities is a pseudo-statement without cognitive content. To be sure, we have to face at this point an important question; but it is a practical, not a theoretical question; it is the question of whether or not to accept the new linguistic forms. The acceptance cannot be judged as being either true or false because it is not an assertion. It can only be judged as being more or less expedient, fruitful, conducive to the aim for which the language is intended. Judgments of this kind supply the motivation for the decision of accepting or rejecting the kind of entities.[4](#4)
我们必须清楚地区分外部问题，即关于新实体的整个系统的存在或现实的哲学问题。许多哲学家将这类问题视为一个本体论问题，必须在引入新的语言形式之前提出和回答。他们认为，后一种介绍只有在能够用本体论的洞察力为现实问题提供肯定的答案来证明其合理性时，才是合法的。与这种观点相反，我们采取的立场是，新说话方式的引入不需要任何理论上的论证，因为它并不意味着对现实的任何断言。我们仍然可以谈论（并且已经这样做了）“接受新实体”，因为这种形式的言语是习俗的;但我们必须记住，这句话对我们来说并不意味着接受新的框架，即接受新的语言形式。最重要的是，它不能被解释为指的是对 “实体的现实” 的假设、信念或断言。没有这样的断言。对实体系统现实的所谓陈述是没有认知内容的伪陈述。可以肯定的是，在这一点上，我们必须面对一个重要的问题;但这是一个实际问题，而不是一个理论问题;而是是否接受新的语言形式的问题。接受不能被判断为真或假，因为它不是一个断言。它只能被判断为或多或少是权宜之计、富有成效的、有利于语言所要达到的目标。这种判断为决定接受或拒绝这类实体提供了动机 4。

Thus it is clear that the acceptance of a linguistic framework must not be regarded as implying a metaphysical doctrine concerning the reality of the entities in question. It seems to me due to a neglect of this important distinction that some contemporary nominalists label the admission of variables of abstract types as "Platonism."[5](#5) This is, to say the least, an extremely misleading terminology. It leads to the absurd consequence, that the position of everybody who accepts the language of physics with its real number variables (as a language of communication, not merely as a calculus) would be called Platonistic, even if he is a strict empiricist who rejects Platonic metaphysics.
因此，很明显，接受语言框架不能被视为暗示关于所讨论实体的现实的形而上学学说。在我看来，由于忽视了这一重要区别，一些当代唯名论者将抽象类型变量的接受称为“柏拉图主义”。5 至少可以说，这是一个极具误导性的术语。这导致了一个荒谬的后果，即每个接受物理学语言及其实数变量（作为一种交流语言，而不仅仅是作为微积分）的立场都会被称为柏拉图主义的，即使他是一个拒绝柏拉图形而上学的严格经验主义者。

A brief historical remark may here be inserted. The non-cognitive character of the questions which we have called here external questions was recognized and emphasized already by the Vienna Circle under the leadership of Moritz Schlick, the group from which the movement of logical empiricism originated. Influenced by ideas of Ludwig Wittgenstein, the Circle rejected both the thesis of the reality of the external world and the thesis of its irreality as pseudo-statements;[6](#6) the same was the case for both the thesis of the reality of universals (abstract entities, in our present terminology) and the nominalistic thesis that they are not real and that their alleged names are not names of anything but merely _flatus vocis_. (It is obvious that the apparent negation of a pseudo-statement must also be a pseudo-statement.) It is therefore not correct to classify the members of the Vienna Circle as nominalists, as is sometimes done. However, if we look at the basic anti-metaphysical and pro-scientific attitude of most nominalists (and the same holds for many materialists and realists in the modern sense), disregarding their occasional pseudo-theoretical formulations, then it is, of course, true to say that the Vienna Circle was much closer to those philosophers than to their opponents.
这里可以插入一个简短的历史评论。我们在这里称之为外部问题的问题的非认知性已经被莫里茨·施利克（Moritz Schlick）领导下的维也纳圈所承认和强调，该团体是逻辑经验主义运动的起源。受路德维希·维特根斯坦 （Ludwig Wittgenstein） 思想的影响，圆环既拒绝了外部世界的现实论点，也拒绝了将其非现实性作为伪陈述的论点;6 关于普遍性（抽象实体，用我们现在的术语来说，是抽象实体）的论点和唯名论的论点也是如此，即它们不是真实的，它们所谓的名称不是任何东西的名称，而只是肠胃胀气。（很明显，伪陈述的明显否定也必须是伪陈述。因此，将维也纳圈的成员归类为唯名论者是不正确的，就像有时所做的那样。然而，如果我们看一下大多数唯物论者的基本反形而上学和亲科学的态度（现代意义上的许多唯物主义者和现实主义者也是如此），不考虑他们偶尔的伪理论表述，那么当然可以说维也纳圈更接近那些哲学家，而不是他们的对手。

### 4. Abstract entities in semantics

4. 语义中的抽象实体

The problem of the legitimacy and the status of abstract entities has recently again led to controversial discussions in connection with semantics. In a semantical meaning analysis certain expressions in a language are often said to designate (or name or denote or signify or refer to) certain extra-linguistic entities.[7](#7) As long as physical things or events (e.g., Chicago or Caesar's death) are taken as designata (entities designated), no serious doubts arise. But strong objections have been raised, especially by some empiricists, against empiricists, against abstract entities as designata, e.g., against semantical statements of the following kind:
抽象实体的合法性和地位问题最近再次导致了与语义学有关的有争议的讨论。在语义意义分析中，一种语言中的某些表达通常被称为指定（或名称、表示、表示或指代）某些语言外实体 7。只要将物理事物或事件（例如，芝加哥或凯撒之死）视为指定（指定的实体），就不会产生严重的疑问。但是，特别是一些经验主义者，已经提出了强烈的反对意见，反对经验主义者，反对作为指定词的抽象实体，例如，反对以下类型的语义陈述：

> (1) "The word 'red' designates a property of things";
> (2) "The word 'color' designates a property of properties of things";
> (3) "The word 'five' designates a number";
> (4) "The word 'odd' designates a property of numbers";
> (5) "The sentence 'Chicago is large' designates a proposition."
> （1） “'红色'一词表示事物的属性”; （2） “'颜色'一词表示事物属性的属性”; （3） “'五'一词表示一个数字”; （4） “'奇数'一词表示数字的属性”; （5） “句子 '芝加哥很大'表示一个命题。”

Those who criticize these statements do not, of course, reject the use of the expressions in question, like "red" or "five"; nor would they deny that these expressions are meaningful. But to be meaningful is not the same as having a meaning in the sense of an entity designated. They reject the belief, which they regard as implicitly presupposed by those semantical statements, that to each expression of the types in question (adjectives like "red," numerals like "five," etc.) there is a particular real entity to which the expression stands in the relation of designation). This belief is rejected as incompatible with the basic principles of empiricism or of scientific thinking. Derogatory labels like "Platonic realism" "hypostatization," or "'Fido'-Fido principle" are attached to it. The latter is the name given by Gilbert Ryle[8](#8) to the criticized belief, which, in his view, arises by a naive inference of analogy: just as there is an entity well known to me, viz. my dog Fido, which is designated by the name "Fido," thus there must be for every meaningful expression a particular entity to which it stands in the relation of designation or naming, i.e., the relation exemplified by "Fido"-Fido. The belief criticized is thus a case of hypostatization, i.e., of treating as names expressions which are not names. While "Fido" is a name, expressions like "red," "five," etc., are said not to be names, not to designate anything.
当然，那些批评这些说法的人并不排斥使用有问题的表达方式，比如 “red” 或 “five”;他们也不会否认这些表达是有意义的。但是，有意义并不等同于具有指定实体意义上的意义。他们拒绝这种信念，他们认为这些信念是由这些语义陈述隐含地预设的，即对于所讨论的类型（形容词如“red”，数字如“five”等）的每个表达，都有一个特定的真实实体，该表达与名称的关系有关）。这种信念被拒绝，因为它与经验主义或科学思维的基本原则不相容。它附有诸如“柏拉图现实主义”、“假设化”或“'Fido'-Fido 原则”等贬义标签。后者是吉尔伯特·莱尔 （Gilbert Ryle）8 给被批评的信念起的名字，在他看来，这种信念是通过一个天真的类比推断而产生的：就像我所熟知的一个实体，即我的狗 Fido，它被命名为“Fido”，因此，对于每一个有意义的表达，都必须有一个特定的实体，它与它的关系是指定的或命名的， 即，以 “Fido”-Fido 为例的关系。因此，被批评的信念是一个虚构化的例子，即把不是名字的表达看作是名字。虽然 “Fido” 是一个名字，但像 “red”、“five” 等这样的表达被称为不是名字，也不是用来指定任何东西。

Our previous discussion concerning the acceptance of frameworks enables us now to clarify the situation with respect to abstract entities as designata. Let us take as an example the statement:
我们之前关于接受框架的讨论使我们能够澄清将抽象实体作为 designata 的情况。让我们以以下语句为例：

> (a) "'Five' designates a number."
> （a） “'五'表示一个数字。”

The formulation of this statement presupposes that our language L contains the forms of expressions which we have called the framework of numbers, in particular, numerical variables and the general term "number." If L contains these forms, the following is an analytic statement in L:
这个陈述的表述假定我们的语言 L 包含我们称为数字框架的表达式形式，特别是数字变量和通用术语“数字”。如果 L 包含这些形式，则以下是 L 中的分析语句：

> (b) "Five is a number."
> （b） “五是一个数字。”

Further, to make the statement (a) possible, L must contain an expression like "designates" or "is a name of" for the semantical relation of designation. If suitable rules for this term are laid down, the following is likewise analytic:
此外，为了使陈述 （a） 成为可能，L 必须包含类似 “designates” 或 “is a name of” 的表达式，用于表示名称的语义关系。如果为这个术语制定了合适的规则，那么以下内容同样具有分析性：

> (c) "'Five' designates five."
> （c） “'五'表示五。”

(Generally speaking, any expression of the form "'. . .' designates . . ." is an analytic statement provided the term ". . ." is a constant in an accepted framework. If the latter condition is not fulfilled, the expression is not a statement.) Since (a) follows from (c) and (b), (a) is likewise analytic.
（一般来说，任何形式为 “'. .' 的表达式指定 . . .是一个分析性陈述，提供了术语 “. . .”是公认框架中的常量。如果未满足后一个条件，则表达式不是 statement.）由于 （a） 源自 （c） 和 （b），因此 （a） 同样是分析性的。

Thus it is clear that _if_ someone accepts the framework of numbers, then he must acknowledge (c) and (b) and hence (a) as true statements. Generally speaking, if someone accepts a framework for a certain kind of entities, then he is bound to admit the entities as possible designata. Thus the question of the admissibility of entities of a certain type or of abstract entities in general as designata is reduced to the question of the acceptability of the linguistic framework for those entities. Both the nominalistic critics, who refuse the status of designators or names to expressions like "red," "five," etc., because they deny the existence of abstract entities, and the skeptics, who express doubts concerning the existence and demand evidence for it, treat the question of existence as a theoretical question. They do, of course, not mean the internal question; the affirmative answer to _this_ question is analytic and trivial and too obvious for doubt or denial, as we have seen. Their doubts refer rather to the system of entities itself; hence they mean the external question. They believe that only after making sure that there really is a system of entities of the kind in question are we justified in accepting the framework by incorporating the linguistic forms into our language. However, we have seen that the external question is not a theoretical question but rather the practical question whether or not to accept those linguistic forms. This acceptance is not in need of a theoretical justification (except with respect to expediency and fruitfulness), because it does not imply a belief or assertion. Ryle says that the "Fido"-Fido principle is "a grotesque theory." Grotesque or not, Ryle is wrong in calling it a theory. It is rather the practical decision to accept certain frameworks. Maybe Ryle is historically right with respect to those whom he mentions as previous representatives of the principle, viz. John Stuart Mill, Frege, and Russell. If these philosophers regarded the acceptance of a system of entities as a theory, an assertion, they were victims of the same old, metaphysical confusion. But it is certainly wrong to regard my semantical method as involving a belief in the reality of abstract entities, since I reject a thesis of this kind as a metaphysical pseudo-statement.
因此，很明显，如果有人接受数字的框架，那么他必须承认 （c） 和 （b） 以及 （a） 是真实的陈述。一般来说，如果某人接受了某种实体的框架，那么他必然会接受这些实体作为可能的指定实体。因此，某种类型的实体或一般作为 designata 的抽象实体的可接受性问题被简化为这些实体的语言框架的可接受性问题。无论是唯名论的批评者，他们拒绝为“红色”、“五”等表达的指示符或名称的地位，因为他们否认抽象实体的存在，而怀疑论者，他们对存在表示怀疑并要求证据证明，都将存在问题视为一个理论问题。当然，他们并不是指内部问题;正如我们所看到的，这个问题的肯定答案是分析性的、微不足道的，而且太明显了，不能怀疑或否认。他们的怀疑更确切地说是实体系统本身;因此，他们指的是外部问题。他们认为，只有在确保确实存在一个相关实体系统之后，我们才有理由通过将语言形式纳入我们的语言来接受框架。然而，我们已经看到，外部问题不是一个理论问题，而是是否接受这些语言形式的实际问题。这种接受不需要理论上的证明（除了权宜之计和成果），因为它并不意味着一种信念或断言。Ryle 说 “Fido”-Fido 原则是 “一个怪诞的理论”。无论是否怪诞，Ryle 称其为理论是错误的。接受某些框架是实际的决定。也许莱尔在历史上是正确的，他提到了那些他提到的作为该原则的前代表的人，即约翰·斯图尔特·穆勒（John Stuart Mill）、弗雷格（Frege）和罗素（Russell）。如果这些哲学家将接受实体系统视为一种理论、一种断言，那么他们就是同样古老的、形而上学的混乱的受害者。但是，将我的语义方法视为涉及对抽象实体现实的信念肯定是错误的，因为我拒绝将这种论点视为形而上学的伪陈述。

The critics of the use of abstract entities in semantics overlook the fundamental difference between the acceptance of a system of entities and an internal assertion, e.g., an assertion that there are elephants or electrons or prime numbers greater than a million. Whoever makes an internal assertion is certainly obliged to justify it by providing evidence, empirical evidence in the case of electrons, logical proof in the case of the prime numbers. The demand for a theoretical justification, correct in the case of internal assertions, is sometimes wrongly applied to the acceptance of a system of entities. Thus, for example, Ernest Nagel in his review[9](#9) asks for "evidence relevant for affirming with warrant that there are such entities as infinitesimals or propositions." He characterizes the evidence required in these cases -- in distinction to the empirical evidence in the case of electrons -- as "in the broad sense logical and dialectical." Beyond this no hint is given as to what might be regarded as relevant evidence. Some nominalists regard the acceptance of abstract entities as a kind of superstition or myth, populating the world with fictitious or at least dubious entities, analogous to the belief in centaurs or demons. This shows again the confusion mentioned, because a superstition or myth is a false (or dubious) internal statement.
在语义中使用抽象实体的批评者忽视了接受实体系统和内部断言之间的根本区别，例如，断言存在大于 100 万的大象或电子或质数。无论谁做出内部断言，当然都有义务通过提供证据来证明它，在电子的情况下是经验证据，在素数的情况下是逻辑证明。对理论理由的要求，在内部断言的情况下是正确的，有时被错误地应用于接受一个实体系统。因此，例如，欧内斯特·内格尔 （Ernest Nagel） 在他的评论 9 中要求提供“与有把握地肯定存在无穷小或命题等实体相关的证据”。他将这些案例中所需的证据——与电子案例中的实证证据不同——描述为“广义上的逻辑和辩证”。除此之外，没有给出关于什么可以被视为相关证据的提示。一些唯名论者将接受抽象实体视为一种迷信或神话，在世界上充斥着虚构的或至少是可疑的实体，类似于对半人马或恶魔的信仰。这再次显示了所提到的混乱，因为迷信或神话是虚假的（或可疑的）内部陈述。

Let us take as example the natural numbers as cardinal numbers, i.e., in contexts like "Here are three books." The linguistic forms of the framework of numbers, including variables and the general term "number," are generally used in our common language of communication; and it is easy to formulate explicit rules for their use. Thus the logical characteristics of this framework are sufficiently clear while many internal questions, i.e., arithmetical questions, are, of course, still open). In spite of this, the controversy concerning the external question of the ontological reality of the system of numbers continues. Suppose that one philosopher says: "I believe that there are numbers as real entities. This gives me the right to use the linguistic forms of the numerical framework and to make semantical statements about numbers as designata of numerals." His nominalistic opponent replies: "You are wrong; there are no numbers. The numerals may still be used as meaningful expressions. But they are not names, there are no entities designated by them. Therefore the word "number" and numerical variables must not be used (unless a way were found to introduce them as merely abbreviating devices, a way of translating them into the nominalistic thing language)." I cannot think of any possible evidence that would be regarded as relevant by both philosophers, and therefore, if actually found, would decide the controversy or at least make one of the opposite theses more probable than the other. (To construe the numbers as classes or properties of the second level, according to the Frege-Russell method, does, of course, not solve the controversy, because the first philosopher would affirm and the second deny the existence of the system of classes or properties of the second level.) Therefore I feel compelled to regard the external question as a pseudo-question, until both parties to the controversy offer a common interpretation of the question as a cognitive question; this would involve an indication of possible evidence regarded as relevant by both sides.
让我们以作为基数的自然数为例，即在像 “Here are three book” 这样的上下文中。数字框架的语言形式，包括变量和通用术语“数字”，通常在我们通用的交流语言中使用;并且很容易为它们的使用制定明确的规则。因此，这个框架的逻辑特征足够清晰，而许多内部问题，即算术问题，当然仍然悬而未决）。尽管如此，关于数字系统本体论现实的外部问题的争论仍在继续。假设一位哲学家说：“我相信有数字是真实的实体。这使我有权使用数字框架的语言形式，并将数字作为数字的指定形式进行语义陈述。他的唯名论反对者回答说：“你错了;没有数字。数字仍可用作有意义的表达式。但他们不是名字，没有他们指定的实体。因此，不能使用“数字”一词和数字变量（除非找到一种方法将它们仅仅作为缩写装置引入，一种将它们翻译成唯名主义事物语言的方法）。我想不出任何可能的证据会被两位哲学家认为是相关的，因此，如果真的找到，将决定争论，或者至少使其中一个相反的论点比另一个更有可能。（根据 Frege-Russell 方法，将数字解释为第二级的类或属性，当然并不能解决争议，因为第一位哲学家会肯定而第二位哲学家会否认第二级的类或属性系统的存在。因此，我觉得有必要将外部问题视为伪问题，直到争论的双方都对这个问题提出了一个共同的解释，即一个认知问题;这将涉及指出双方都认为相关的可能证据。

There is a particular kind of misinterpretation of the acceptance of abstract entities in various fields of science and in semantics, that needs to be cleared up. Certain early British empiricists (e.g., Berkeley and Hume) denied the existence of abstract entities on the ground that immediate experience presents us only with particulars, not with universals, e.g., with this red patch, but not with Redness or Color-in-General; with this scalene triangle, but not with Scalene Triangularity or Triangularity-in-General. Only entities belonging to a type of which examples were to be found within immediate experience could be accepted as ultimate constituents of reality. Thus, according to this way of thinking, the existence of abstract entities could be asserted only if one could show either that some abstract entities fall within the given, or that abstract entities can be defined in terms of the types of entity which are given. Since these empiricists found no abstract entities within the realm of sense-data, they either denied their existence, or else made a futile attempt to define universals in terms of particulars. Some contemporary philosophers, especially English philosophers following Bertrand Russell, think in basically similar terms. They emphasize a distinction between the data (that which is immediately given in consciousness, e.g., sense-data, immediately past experiences, etc.) and the constructs based on the data. Existence or reality is ascribed only to the data; the constructs are not real entities; the corresponding linguistic expressions are merely ways of speech not actually designating anything (reminiscent of the nominalists' _flatus vocis_). We shall not criticize here this general conception. (As far as it is a principle of accepting certain entities and not accepting others, leaving aside any ontological, phenomenalistic and nominalistic pseudo-statements, there cannot be any theoretical objection to it.) But if this conception leads to the view that other philosophers or scientists who accept abstract entities thereby assert or imply their occurrence as immediate data, then such a view must be rejected as a misinterpretation. References to space-time points, the electromagnetic field, or electrons in physics, to real or complex numbers and their functions in mathematics, to the excitatory potential or unconscious complexes in psychology, to an inflationary trend in economics, and the like, do not imply the assertion that entities of these kinds occur as immediate data. And the same holds for references to abstract entities as designata in semantics. Some of the criticisms by English philosophers against such references give the impression that, probably due to the misinterpretation just indicated, they accuse the semanticist not so much of bad metaphysics (as some nominalists would do) but of bad psychology. The fact that they regard a semantical method involving abstract entities not merely as doubtful and perhaps wrong, but as manifestly absurd, preposterous and grotesque, and that they show a deep horror and indignation against this method, is perhaps to be explained by a misinterpretation of the kind described. In fact, of course, the semanticist does not in the least assert or imply that the abstract entities to which he refers can be experienced as immediately given either by sensation or by a kind of rational intuition. An assertion of this kind would indeed be very dubious psychology. The psychological question as to which kinds of entities do and which do not occur as immediate data is entirely irrelevant for semantics, just as it is for physics, mathematics, economic;, etc., with respect to the examples mentioned above.[10](#10)
在各个科学领域和语义学中，对抽象实体的接受存在一种特殊的误解，需要澄清。某些早期的英国经验主义者（例如贝克莱和休谟）否认抽象实体的存在，理由是直接经验只向我们呈现了细节，而不是普遍性，例如，带有这个红色斑块，而不是红色或一般颜色;与这个斜角三角形一起使用，但不与斜角三角形或一般三角形一起使用。只有属于在直接经验中可以找到例子的类型的实体才能被接受为现实的最终组成部分。因此，根据这种思维方式，只有当人们能够证明某些抽象实体属于给定的实体，或者抽象实体可以根据给定的实体类型来定义时，才能断言抽象实体的存在。由于这些经验主义者在感官数据的领域中没有发现抽象实体，他们要么否认它们的存在，要么徒劳地试图用特殊性来定义普遍性。一些当代哲学家，尤其是追随伯特兰·罗素（Bertrand Russell）的英国哲学家，以基本相似的术语思考。他们强调数据（在意识中立即给出的东西，例如，感官数据、立即过去的经验等）和基于数据的建构之间的区别。存在或现实仅归因于数据;构造不是真实的实体;相应的语言表达只是语言方式，实际上并没有指定任何东西（让人想起唯名论者的 flatus vocis）。我们在这里不打算批评这个一般的概念。（就接受某些实体而不接受其他实体的原则而言，撇开任何本体论、现象论和唯名论的伪陈述不谈，不可能有任何理论上的反对意见。但是，如果这种概念导致其他接受抽象实体的哲学家或科学家因此断言或暗示它们的出现是直接数据，那么这种观点必须作为误解而被拒绝。提到物理学中的时空点、电磁场或电子，数学中提到实数或复数及其函数，心理学中提到兴奋性势能或无意识情结，经济学中提到通货膨胀趋势，等等，并不意味着这些类型的实体是作为直接数据出现的断言。对于语义中 designata 等抽象实体的引用也是如此。英国哲学家对此类引用的一些批评给人的印象是，可能是由于刚才指出的误解，他们指责语义学家与其说是糟糕的形而上学（就像一些唯名论者会做的那样），不如说是糟糕的心理学。他们认为一种涉及抽象实体的语义方法不仅是可疑的，也许是错误的，而且是明显的荒谬、荒谬和怪诞的，而且他们对这种方法表现出深深的恐惧和愤慨，这一事实也许可以用所描述的那种误解来解释。事实上，当然，语义学家丝毫没有断言或暗示他所指的抽象实体可以通过感觉或一种理性直觉立即被体验到。这种断言确实是非常可疑的心理学。关于哪些类型的实体作为直接数据出现，哪些类型的实体不作为直接数据出现的心理学问题与语义学完全无关，就像物理学、数学、经济学等与上述例子无关一样 10。

### 5. Conclusion  总结

For those who want to develop or use semantical methods, the decisive question is not the alleged ontological question of the existence of abstract entities but rather the question whether the rise of abstract linguistic foms or, in technical terms, the use of variables beyond those for things (or phenomenal data), is expedient and fruitful for the purposes for which semantical analyses are made, viz. the analysis, interpretation, clarification, or construction of languages of communication, especially languages of science. This question is here neither decided nor even discussed. It is not a question simply of yes or no, but a matter of degree. Among those philosophers who have carried out semantical analyses and thought about suitable tools for this work, beginning with Plato and Aristotle and, in a more technical way on the basis of modern logic, with C. S. Peirce and Frege, a great majority accepted abstract entities. This does, of course, not prove the case. After all, semantics in the technical sense is still in the initial phases of its development, and we must be prepared for possible fundamental changes in methods. Let us therefore admit that the nominalistic critics may possibly be right. But if so, they will have to offer better arguments than they have so far. Appeal to ontological insight will not carry much weight. The critics will have to show that it is possible to construct a semantical method which avoids all references to abstract entities and achieves by simpler means essentially the same results as the other methods.  
对于那些想要发展或使用语义方法的人来说，决定性的问题不是抽象实体存在的所谓本体论问题，而是抽象语言学的兴起，或者用技术术语来说，使用超出事物（或现象数据）的变量的变量，对于进行语义分析的目的是有利和富有成效的问题。 即交流语言的分析、解释、澄清或构建，尤其是科学语言。这个问题在这里既没有决定，也没有讨论。这不仅仅是一个是或否的问题，而是一个程度的问题。在那些进行语义分析并思考适合这项工作的工具的哲学家中，从柏拉图和亚里士多德开始，以更技术性的方式在现代逻辑的基础上，以 CS 皮尔斯和弗雷格的方式，绝大多数接受了抽象实体。当然，这并不能证明情况。毕竟，技术意义上的语义学仍处于其发展的初始阶段，我们必须为方法上可能发生的根本性变化做好准备。因此，让我们承认，唯名论的批评家可能是对的。但如果是这样，他们将不得不提供比目前更好的论点。诉诸本体论的洞察力不会有太大的分量。批评者必须证明，可以构建一种语义方法，该方法避免了对抽象实体的所有引用，并通过更简单的方式实现了与其他方法基本相同的结果。

The acceptance or rejection of abstract linguistic forms, just as the acceptance or rejection of any other linguistic forms in any branch of science, will finally be decided by their efficiency as instruments, the ratio of the results achieved to the amount and complexity of the efforts required. To decree dogmatic prohibitions of certain linguistic forms instead of testing them by their success or failure in practical use, is worse than futile; it is positively harmful because it may obstruct scientific progress. The history of science shows examples of such prohibitions based on prejudices deriving from religious, mythological, metaphysical, or other irrational sources, which slowed up the developments for shorter or longer periods of time. Let us learn from the lessons of history. Let us grant to those who work in any special field of investigation the freedom to use any form of expression which seems useful to them; the work in the field will sooner or later lead to the elimination of those forms which have no useful function. _Let us be cautious in making assertions and critical in examining them, but tolerant in permitting linguistic forms._  
抽象语言形式的接受或拒绝，就像任何科学分支中对任何其他语言形式的接受或拒绝一样，最终将取决于它们作为工具的效率，所取得的成果与所需努力的数量和复杂性的比率。颁布教条式的禁止某些语言形式，而不是用它们在实际应用中的成败来检验它们，这比徒劳更糟糕;它是有害的，因为它可能会阻碍科学进步。科学史显示了基于来自宗教、神话、形而上学或其他非理性来源的偏见的此类禁令的例子，这些偏见在较短或较长的时间内减缓了发展。让我们从历史的教训中吸取教训。让我们给予那些在任何特殊研究领域工作的人自由，让他们使用任何对他们来说有用的表达形式;该领域的工作迟早会导致那些没有有用功能的形式被淘汰。让我们在做出断言时谨慎，在检查它们时要持批判性态度，但在允许语言形式时要宽容。

> ### Notes 笔记

[\*](#*b1) I have made here some minor changes in the formulations to the effect that the term "framework" is now used only for the system of linguistic expressions, and not for the system of the entities in question.  
\* 我在这里对表述做了一些细微的修改，大意是“框架”一词现在只用于语言表达系统，而不用于所讨论的实体系统。

[1](#1b) The terms "sentence" and "statement" are here used synonymously for declarative (indicative propositional) sentences.  
1 术语“句子”和“陈述”在这里是陈述性（陈述性命题）句子的同义词。

[2](#2b) In my book _Meaning and Necessity_ (Chicago, 1947) I have developed a semantical method which takes propositions as entities designated by sentences (more specifically, as intensions of sentences). In order to facilitate the understanding of the systematic development, I added some informal, extra-systematic explanations concerning the nature of propositions. I said that the term "proposition" "is used neither for a linguistic expression nor for a subjective, mental occurrence, but rather for something objective that may or may not be exemplified in nature. . . . . We apply the term 'proposition' to any entities of a certain logical type, namely, those that may be expressed by (declarative) sentences in a language" (p. 27). After some more detailed discussions concerning the relation between propositions and facts, and the nature of false propositions, I added: "It has been the purpose of the preceding remarks to facilitate the understanding of our conception of propositions. If, however, a reader should find these explanations more puzzling than clarifying, or even unacceptable, he may disregard them" (p. 31) (that is, disregard these extra-systematic explanations, not the whole theory of the propositions as intensions of sentences, as one reviewer understood). In spite of this warning, it seems that some of those readers who were puzzled by the explanations, did not disregard them but thought that by raising objections against them they could refute the theory. This is analogous to the procedure of some laymen who by (correctly) criticizing the ether picture or other visualizations of physical theories, thought they had refuted those theories. Perhaps the discussions in the present paper will help in clarifying the role of the system of linguistic rules for the introduction of a framework for entities on the one hand, and that of extra-systematic explanations concerning the nature of the entities on the other.  
2 在我的书《意义与必要性》（芝加哥，1947 年）中，我开发了一种语义方法，该方法将命题视为由句子指定的实体（更具体地说，作为句子的意图）。为了便于理解系统的发展，我添加了一些关于命题性质的非正式的、超系统的解释。我说过，“命题”一词“既不用于语言表达，也不用于主观的心理事件，而是指在自然界中可能或可能不会体现的客观事物。我们将'命题'一词应用于某种逻辑类型的任何实体，即那些可能由某种语言中的（陈述性）句子表达的实体“（第 27 页）。在对命题和事实之间的关系以及假命题的性质进行了一些更详细的讨论之后，我补充说：“前面评论的目的是为了促进理解我们的命题概念。然而，如果读者觉得这些解释比澄清更令人费解，甚至不可接受，他可以无视它们“（第 31 页）（也就是说，无视这些超系统的解释，而不是像一位评论家所理解的那样，无视作为句子意图的命题的整个理论）。尽管有这样的警告，但似乎一些对解释感到困惑的读者并没有无视它们，而是认为通过提出反对意见，他们可以反驳这个理论。这类似于一些外行人的程序，他们通过（正确地）批评以太图或其他物理理论的可视化，认为他们已经驳斥了这些理论。也许本文中的讨论将有助于阐明语言规则系统的作用，一方面用于引入实体框架，另一方面有助于阐明关于实体性质的超系统解释的作用。

[3](#3b) W.V. Quine was the first to recognize the importance of the introduction of variables as indicating the acceptance of entities. "The ontology to which one's use of language commits him comprises simply the objects that he treats as falling . . . within the range of values of his variables." "Notes on Existence and Necessity," _Journal of Philosophy_, Vol. 40 (1943), pp. 113-127; compare also his "Designation and Existence," _Journal of Philosophy_, Vol. 36 (1939), pp. 702-709, and "On Universals," _The Journal of Symbolic Logic_, Vol. 12 (1947), pp. 74-84.  
3 W.V. Quine 是第一个认识到引入变量的重要性的人，因为它表明了对实体的接受。“一个人使用语言所赋予的本体论只包括他认为是坠落的物体......在他的变量的值范围内。“关于存在和必然性的笔记”，《哲学杂志》，第 40 卷（1943 年），第 113-127 页;还可以比较他的“指定与存在”，《哲学杂志》，第 36 卷（1939 年），第 702-709 页，以及“论普遍性”，《符号逻辑杂志》，第 12 卷（1947 年），第 74-84 页。

[4](#4b) For a closely related point of view on these questions see the detailed discussions in Herbert Feigl, "Existential Hypotheses," _Philosophy of Science_, 17 (1950), pp. 35-62.  
4 关于这些问题的密切相关的观点，参见赫伯特·费格尔（Herbert Feigl）的《存在主义假设》（Existential Hypotheses），《科学哲学》（Philosophy of Science），第 17 卷（1950 年），第 35-62 页。

[5](#5b) Paul Bernays, "Sur le platonisme dans les mathematiques" (_L'Enseignement math._, 34 (1935), 52-69). W.V. Quine, see previous footnote and a recent paper "On What There Is," _Review of Metaphysics_, Vol 2 (1948), pp. 21-38. Quine does not acknowledge the distinction which I emphasize above, because according to his general conception there are no sharp boundary lines between logical and factual truth, between questions of meaning and questions of fact, between the acceptance of a language structure and the acceptance of an assertion formulated in the language. This conception, which seems to deviate considerably from customary ways of thinking, is explained in his article "Semantics and Abstract Objects," _Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences_, 80 (1951), 90-96. When Quine in the article "On What There Is," classifies my logistic conception of mathematics (derived from Frege and Russell) as "platonic realism" (p. 33), this is meant (according to a personal communication from him) not as ascribing to me agreement with Plato's metaphysical doctrine of universals, but merely as referring to the fact that I accept a language of mathematics containing variables of higher levels. With respect to the basic attitude to take in choosing a language form (an "ontology" in Quine's terminology, which seems to me misleading), there appears now to be agreement between us: "the obvious counsel is tolerance and an experimental spirit" ("On What There Is," p. 38).  
5 保罗·伯奈斯，“Sur le platonisme dans les mathematiques” （L'Enseignement math.， 34 （1935）， 52-69）.W.V. Quine，见前面的脚注和最近的一篇论文“论存在什么”，《形而上学评论》，第 2 卷（1948 年），第 21-38 页。奎因不承认我上面强调的区别，因为根据他的一般概念，在逻辑真理和事实真理之间，在意义问题和事实问题之间，在接受语言结构和接受语言中形成的断言之间，没有明显的界限。这个概念似乎与惯常的思维方式大相径庭，在他的文章“语义和抽象对象”中进行了解释，《美国艺术与科学院院刊》，80 （1951），90-96。当奎因在《论存在什么》一文中将我对数学的逻辑概念（源自弗雷格和罗素）归类为“柏拉图现实主义”（第 33 页）时，这意味着（根据他个人的通信）并不意味着我同意柏拉图的形而上学普遍性学说，而仅仅是指我接受一种包含更高层次变量的数学语言这一事实。关于选择一种语言形式时要采取的基本态度（Quine 术语中的“本体论”，在我看来似乎具有误导性），我们现在似乎达成了共识：“显而易见的建议是宽容和实验精神”（“On What There Is”，第 38 页）。

The distinction I have drawn in the latter book between the method of the name-relation and the method of intension and extension is not essential for our present discussion. The term "designation" is used in the present article in a neutral way; it may be understood as referring to the name-relation or to the intension relation or to the extension-relation or to any similar relations used in other semantical methods.
