# **Type Theory**

## Introduction

In the study of **formal systems**, **type theory** plays a crucial role. It is a branch of mathematical logic and theoretical computer science that deals with the classification of data into different **types**. This classification helps in ensuring that operations are performed on appropriate data, thereby preventing errors and enhancing the reliability of programs and proofs.

## Key Concepts

- **Types**: Categories or sets of values.
- **Terms**: Elements or inhabitants of types.
- **Judgments**: Assertions about terms and types.
- **Rules**: Mechanisms for deriving judgments from other judgments.

## Applications

Type theory has numerous applications across various fields:

- **Programming Languages**: Used to design type systems that enhance program safety and correctness.
- **Proof Assistants**: Facilitates formal verification of mathematical proofs.
- **Logic**: Provides a foundation for constructive mathematics and intuitionistic logic.

## Variants

There are several variants of type theory, each with its own features and applications:

- **Simple Type Theory (STT)**: A basic form of type theory.
- **Dependent Type Theory (DTT)**: Allows types to depend on terms.
- **Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT)**: Integrates concepts from algebraic topology.

## Historical Development

The development of type theory has been influenced by many key figures and milestones:

- **Bertrand Russell**: Introduced the concept of types to resolve paradoxes in set theory.
- **Alonzo Church**: Developed the lambda calculus, which laid the foundation for modern type theories.
- **Per Martin-Löf**: Formulated **intuitionistic type theory**, which has become a cornerstone in the field.

## Modern Advances

Recent advancements in type theory include:

- **Univalent Foundations**: Proposes a new foundation for mathematics based on homotopy type theory.
- **Cubical Type Theory**: Offers a computational interpretation of univalence and higher inductive types.

## Conclusion

Type theory continues to be an active area of research with significant implications for both mathematics and computer science. Its ability to provide rigorous foundations for reasoning about programs and proofs makes it an indispensable tool in the modern era of formal methods.

## 1. Paradoxes and Russell’s Type Theories

In the study of logic and the foundations of mathematics, **paradoxes** have played a crucial role in shaping our understanding of formal systems. One of the most significant responses to these paradoxes came from **Bertrand Russell**, who introduced his **Type Theories** as a means to address the inconsistencies that arise in naive set theory.

## 1.1 The Nature of Paradoxes

A **paradox** is a statement or group of statements that leads to a contradiction or a situation which defies intuition. In the context of logic and set theory, paradoxes often arise from self-reference or circular definitions, leading to contradictions within the system.

## 1.2 Russell’s Response: Type Theory

Russell’s **Type Theory** was developed to prevent such paradoxes by introducing a hierarchy of types. According to this theory, each entity belongs to a specific type, and operations or predicates can only be applied to entities of appropriate types. This hierarchical structure ensures that self-referential statements, which are often the source of paradoxes, cannot be formulated within the system.

## 1.3 Implications and Applications

The introduction of **Type Theory** had profound implications for the development of logic and the foundations of mathematics. It influenced not only the work of Russell himself but also that of other logicians and mathematicians, leading to further refinements and alternative approaches to addressing paradoxes.

By structuring the theory in this way, Russell aimed to create a more robust and consistent framework for reasoning about sets and propositions, thereby avoiding the pitfalls of earlier, less rigorous formulations.

## The Theory of Types

The **theory of types** was introduced by **Russell** in order to cope with some contradictions he found in his account of **set theory** and was introduced in “**Appendix B: The Doctrine of Types**” of Russell 1903. This contradiction was obtained by analysing a theorem of **Cantor** that no mapping

## 函数定义

考虑函数 **F** 定义如下：

## 映射关系

\[ F: X \rightarrow \text{Pow}(X) \]

这里，**F** 是从集合 **X** 到其幂集 **Pow(X)** 的映射。

## Proof of the Non-Surjectivity of \( F \)

Consider the class **Pow(X)**, which is the class of subclasses of a class \( X \). The function \( F \) from \( X \) to **Pow(X)** cannot be **surjective**; that is, \( F \) cannot be such that every member \( b \) of **Pow(X)** is equal to \( F(a) \) for some element \( a \) of \( X \). This can be phrased "intuitively" as the fact that there are more subsets of \( X \) than elements of \( X \).

## Proof

The proof of this fact is so simple and basic that it is worthwhile giving it here. Consider the following subset of \( X \):

\[ A = \{ x \in X \mid x \notin F(x) \} \]

This subset \( A \) is constructed in such a way that for any element \( x \) in \( X \), \( x \) is included in \( A \) if and only if \( x \) is not an element of the subset \( F(x) \).

Now, suppose for contradiction that \( F \) is surjective. Then there must exist some element \( a \) in \( X \) such that \( F(a) = A \). 

- If \( a \in A \), then by definition of \( A \), \( a \notin F(a) = A \), which is a contradiction.
- If \( a \notin A \), then by definition of \( A \), \( a \in F(a) = A \), which is also a contradiction.

Therefore, no such element \( a \) can exist, and hence \( F \) cannot be surjective. This completes the proof.

## 定义与推理

## 集合定义

设 \( A = \{ x \in X \mid x \notin F(x) \} \). 这个**子集**不能在**映射** \( F \) 的值域中。因为如果 \( A = F(a) \)，对于某个 \( a \)，那么：

- 如果 \( a \in A \)，根据 \( A \) 的定义，\( a \notin F(a) \)，即 \( a \notin A \)，这是一对矛盾。
- 如果 \( a \notin A \)，则根据 \( A \) 的定义，\( a \in F(a) \)，即 \( a \in A \)，这也是一对矛盾。

因此，\( A \) 不能等于任何 \( F(a) \)，也就是说 \( A \) 不在 \( F \) 的值域中。

## 数学表达整理

## 符号定义与逻辑关系

考虑以下逻辑关系：

\[
a \in F(a) \text{ iff } a \in A
\]

\[
a \in A \text{ iff } a \not\in F(a)
\]

通过上述表达式，可以推导出：

\[
a \in F(a) \text{ iff } a \not\in F(a)
\]

这表明存在一个**矛盾**，即：

\[
\begin{align}
a \in F(a) &\text{ iff } a \in A \\
&\text{ iff } a \not\in F(a)
\end{align}
\]

这种结构揭示了在给定条件下，元素 \(a\) 是否属于集合 \(F(a)\) 和集合 \(A\) 之间的复杂关系。

## Some Remarks

This is a contradiction. Some remarks are in order.

## Key Points

1. **First**, the proof does not use the **law of excluded middle** and is thus valid **intuitionistically**.
   
2. **Second**, the method that is used, called **diagonalisation**, was already present in the work of **du Bois-Reymond** for building real functions growing faster than any function in a given sequence of functions.

Russell analysed what happens if we apply this theorem to the case where **A** is the class of all classes, admitting that there is such a class. He was then led to consider the special class of classes that do not belong to themselves.

## 数学表达式

## 定义

(\*)**R** = { w ∣ w ∉ w }.\\tag{\*} **R** = \\{ w \\mid w \\not\\in w \\}.

## 推理

We then have

## Russell's Paradox and Its Implications

## The Paradox Statement

R \\in R \\text{ iff } R \\not\\in R.

It seems indeed that **Cantor** was already aware of the fact that the class of all sets cannot be considered itself to be a set. 

## Communication with Frege

**Russell** communicated this problem to **Frege**, and his letter, together with Frege’s answer, appear in van Heijenoort 1967. It is important to realise that the formulation (\*) does not apply as it is to Frege’s system.

## Distinction Between Predicates and Objects

As **Frege** himself wrote in his reply to Russell, the expression “a predicate is predicated of itself” is not exact. Frege had a distinction between _predicates_ (concepts) and _objects_. A (first-order) predicate applies to an object but it cannot have a predicate as an argument.

## Formulation of the Paradox in Frege’s System

The exact formulation of the paradox in Frege’s system uses the notion of the **extension** of a predicate PPP, which we designate as \\varepsilon P. The extension of a predicate is itself an object. The important **Axiom V** is:

...

(Note: The text ends abruptly here, suggesting that further details about Axiom V or additional context might follow.)

## Axiom V

The **Axiom V** is expressed as follows:

\[
\varepsilon P = \varepsilon Q \equiv \forall x [P(x) \equiv Q(x)]
\]

This axiom states that the **ε-terms** \(\varepsilon P\) and \(\varepsilon Q\) are equal if and only if the predicates \(P(x)\) and \(Q(x)\) are equivalent for all \(x\). 

\[
\tag{Axiom V} \varepsilon P = \varepsilon Q \equiv \forall x [P(x) \equiv Q(x)]
\]

## This Axiom

This **axiom** asserts that the extension of **PPP** is identical to the extension of **QQQ** if and only if **PPP** and **QQQ** are materially equivalent. 

We can then translate **Russell’s paradox** (\*) in **Frege’s system** by defining the **predicate**:

... (It seems like the text was cut off here, so the predicate definition is not provided.)

```markdown
## **R(x)** 定义

**R(x)** \\text{ iff } \\exists P\[x = \\varepsilon P \\wedge \\neg P(x)\]

## 解释

- **R(x)**  \\text{ iff } \\exists P\[x = \\varepsilon P \\wedge \\neg P(x)\]
```

请注意，提供的文本似乎是一个数学或逻辑表达式。为了保持其原始逻辑结构和上下文连贯性，我将其整理为上述Markdown格式。如果有更多上下文或进一步的解释需求，请告知。

## Verification Using Axiom V

It can then been checked, using **Axiom V** in a crucial way, that

## 符号逻辑表达式

## 定义与等价关系

在本节中，我们将探讨一个特定的符号逻辑表达式及其等价关系：

\[ R(\varepsilon R) \equiv \neg R(\varepsilon R) \]

该表达式表示 **R(εR)** 与其否定之间的等价关系。具体来说：

- **R(εR)** 表示某种逻辑命题或关系。
- **\(\neg R(\varepsilon R)\)** 表示 **R(εR)** 的否定。

根据上述定义，表达式表明 **R(εR)** 与其自身的否定是等价的，这在逻辑上是一个自相矛盾的情况。

## 数学符号解释

为了更清晰地理解该表达式，我们可以进一步解释其中的符号：

- **ε**：通常表示空字符串或空元素。
- **R**：代表某个关系或命题。
- **\(\equiv\)**：表示逻辑等价。
- **\(\neg\)**：表示逻辑否定。

因此，整个表达式可以解读为：当关系 **R** 应用于空元素 **ε** 时，其结果与自身否定等价。

## Contradiction and Predicative Systems

We have a **contradiction** as well. (Notice that for defining the predicate **RRR**, we have used an _impredicative_ existential quantification on predicates. It can be shown that the _predicative_ version of **Frege’s system** is consistent (see Heck 1996 and for further refinements Ferreira 2002).

## Types in Frege’s Work

It is clear from this account that an idea of **types** was already present in **Frege’s work**: there we find a distinction between objects, predicates (or concepts), predicates of predicates, etc. (This point is stressed in Quine 1940.) This hierarchy is called the “extensional hierarchy” by **Russell (1959)**, and its necessity was recognised by Russell as a consequence of his paradox.
