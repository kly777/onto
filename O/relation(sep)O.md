# Relations

_First published Tue Feb 9, 2016; substantive revision Wed Oct 28, 2020_

The world we inhabit isn’t an undifferentiated bog. Everywhere there’s repetition and, importantly, we can even distinguish different types of repetition. We see one _cat_ and then another _cat_. But we can also see that our cat is _on top of_ the mat and subsequently notice that the cat from next door is _on top of_ the fence. Repetition in the first sense requires only one thing and then another. By contrast, repetition in the second sense requires two (or more) things and then two (or more) other things. Properties are typically introduced to account for repetition in the first sense, whereas relations are typically introduced to account for repetition in the second sense. There’s cat repetition because there is more than one thing that has a certain property, the property of being a cat. There’s above-and-below repetition because there is more than one thing that bears a certain relation to something else, the relation that holds between two things when one is on top of the other.

It’s doubtful whether the distinction between properties and relations can be given in terms that do not ultimately presuppose it—the distinction is so basic. Nevertheless, there are elucidations on offer that may help us better appreciate the distinction. Properties merely hold _of_ the things that have them, whereas relations aren’t relations _of_ anything, but hold _between_ things, or, alternatively, relations are _borne_ by one thing _to_ other things, or, another alternative paraphrase, relations have a subject of inherence _whose_ relations they are and termini _to which_ they relate the subject. More examples may help too. When we say that a thing AAA is black, or AAA is long, then we are asserting that there is some property AAA has. But when we say that AAA is (wholly) inside BBB then we are asserting that there is a relation in which AAA stands to BBB.

Be careful though not to be misled by these examples. AAA can only be (wholly) inside BBB if AAA is distinct from BBB. So the relation in which AAA stands to BBB if AAA is (wholly) inside BBB requires a distinct subject from terminus. By contrast, AAA can be black without prejudice to anything else. But we cannot infer straightaway that every relation holds between more than one thing because there may be some relations that a thing bears to itself, if, for example, identity is a relation. So we cannot distinguish properties from relations by appealing to the number of distinct things required for their exhibition, since these may be the same, viz. one. Hence the plausibility of thinking that a relation differs from a property because a relation, unlike a property, proceeds _from_ a subject _to_ a terminus, even if the subject and terminus are identical.

Theories of relations add to, subtract from or qualify this basic package of ideas in various ways. But with the distinction between properties and relations in hand we can already do some worthwhile conceptual geography, distinguishing four regions of logical space. (1) Rejection of both properties and relations. (2) Acceptance of properties but rejection of relations. (3) Acceptance of relations but rejection of properties. (4) Acceptance of both properties and relations. (1) amounts to a form of thoroughgoing nominalism and is typically motivated by a blanket aversion to the doctrine that general words like “black” or “before” refer to worldly items, whether properties or relations. By contrast, (2), (3) and (4) amount to different forms of realism, whether about properties and/or relations. Typically they are motivated either by an especial antipathy toward relations (2) or, alternatively, an appreciation of their distinctive utility ((3) and (4)). Here we will focus upon what it is about relations in particular that makes philosophers either love them or hate them.

## 1\. Preliminary Distinctions

To understand the contemporary debate about relations we will need to have some logical and philosophical distinctions in place. These distinctions aren’t to be taken for granted. Part of the development of the debate has consisted in the refinement of precisely these distinctions. But you need to understand how, relatively speaking, things got started.

To begin let’s distinguish between the “degree” or “adicity” or “arity” of relations (see, e.g., Armstrong 1978b: 75). Properties are “one-place” or “monadic” or “unary” because properties are only exhibited by particulars or other items, e.g., properties, individually or one by one. Relations are “many-place” or “nnn\-adic” or “nnn\-ary” (where n\>1)n\>1)n\\gt 1) because they are exhibited by particulars only in relation to other particulars. A “2-place” or “dyadic” or “binary” relation is exhibited by one particular only in relation to another. A “3-place” or “triadic” or “ternary” relation is exhibited by one particular only in relation to exactly two others. And so on. Some examples. The relation that xxx stands to yyy whenever xxx is _adjacent_ to yyy is binary. This is because it takes two things to be adjacent to one another. The relation that xxx stands to yyy and zzz whenever xxx is _between_ yyy and zzz is ternary because it takes three things for one to fall between the other two.

In these terms, a relation can be distinguished from a “relational property”. Whereas a relation is borne by one thing to another thing (possibly, in certain cases, to the same thing), a relational property is the property of bearing a relation to something. Suppose aaa bears a relation RRR to bbb. Then aaa has the relational property of bearing RRR to bbb whilst bbb has the property of aaa’s bearing RRR to it. Here RRR is binary whilst the relational properties are unary because they are had by single things, aaa and bbb respectively. For example, marriage is a relation between two people but being married to Cleopatra is a relational property had by Antony whilst being married to Antony is a relational property had by Cleopatra.

A “unigrade” relation RRR is a relation that has a definite degree or adicity: RRR is either binary or ternary… or nnn\-ary (for some unique nnn). By contrast a relation is “multigrade” if it fails to be unigrade (the expression is owed to Leonard & Goodman 1940: 50). Putative examples include causal, biological, physical, geometrical, intentional and logical relations. Causation appears to be multigrade because a certain number of events may be required to bring about an effect on one occasion, and a different number of events may be required to bring about an effect on another. Similarly, entailment appears to be a multigrade relation because a certain number of premises may be required to entail one conclusion but a different number of premises to entail another. Whether there are any multigrade relations and exactly what it means to be multigrade is a fraught matter (see Armstrong 1978b: 93–4, 1997: 85, 2010: 23–5 and Dixon 2019: 64–7 for arguments against multigrade relations and Morton 1975, Fine 2000: 22, MacBride 2005: 569–93 and Hossack 2007: 45–55 for arguments in favour of them).

Next, let’s draw a preliminary three-fold distinction between binary relations in terms of their behaviour with respect to the things they relate. A binary relation RRR is _symmetric_ iff whenever xxx bears RRR to yyy, yyy bears RRR to xxx. By contrast, RRR is _non-symmetric_ iff RRR fails to be symmetric. _Asymmetric_ relations are a special case of non-symmetric ones: R is asymmetric iff whenever xxx bears RRR to yyy then yyy does not bear RRR to xxx. So whilst all asymmetric relations are non-symmetric, not all non-symmetric relations are asymmetric. Some examples. Whenever xxx is married to yyy, yyy is married to xxx. So the relation in which xxx stands to yyy when xxx is married to yyy is a symmetric relation. But if xxx loves yyy, it isn’t guaranteed that yyy loves xxx. Because, alas, sometimes love is unrequited. So the relation in which xxx stands to yyy when xxx loves yyy is a non-symmetric relation. But love doesn’t have to go unrequited otherwise far fewer people would get married, only cynics and gold diggers. So this relation isn’t asymmetric. By contrast, the relation in which xxx stands to yyy when xxx is taller than yyy is asymmetric because if xxx is taller than yyy then yyy isn’t taller than xxx. This doesn’t exhaust the logical classification of relations. It’s easy to see that further distinctions will need be drawn. Consider, for example, the _between_ relation. It’s a ternary relation that is symmetric in the sense that if xxx is between yyy and zzz then xxx is between zzz and yyy. But the _between_ relation isn’t _completely_ or _strictly_ symmetric because it’s not the case that if xxx is between yyy and zzz then yyy is between xxx and zzz. So the distinction between symmetric and non-symmetric relations for nnn\-ary relations, where n\>2n\>2n \\gt 2, will need to be qualified. (In what follows we restrict ourselves to the more straightforward cases discussed in the philosophical literature on relations. But see Russell 1919: 41–52 for a more wide-ranging discussion of the logical variety of relations.)

Nevertheless, equipped with this three-fold distinction for binary distinction we can now appreciate the significance of one contemporary debate about relations. Our ordinary and scientific views of the world are replete with descriptions of things that are non-symmetrically or asymmetrically related. For this reason, Russell advocating admitting both non-symmetric and asymmetric relations alongside symmetric ones (Russell 1903: §§212–6, 1914: 58–9, 1924: 339). But, more recently, it has been questioned whether it is necessary to admit non-symmetric and asymmetric relations at all, i.e., it has been argued that the world contains only symmetric relations by Armstrong 1997: 143–4; Dorr 2004: 180–7; Simons 2010: 207–1, but for counter-arguments see MacBride 2015: 178–94.

Now non-symmetric relations, including asymmetric ones, are typically described as imposing an order upon the things they relate; they admit of what is also called _differential application_ (Fine 2000: 8). This means that for any such non-symmetric RRR there are multiple different ways in which RRR potentially applies to the things it relates. Why? If the way that _loves_ applies to aaa and bbb when aaa loves bbb were no different from the way that _loves_ applies to them when bbb loves aaa, then the _loves_ relation couldn’t be non-symmetric, because otherwise aaa couldn’t love bbb without bbb’s loving aaa. So we have to distinguish between the two different ways that _loves_ is capable of applying to aaa and bbb. Similarly we can distinguish the six different ways that the ternary _between_ relation potentially applies to three things. By contrast, we’re not required by the same reasoning to distinguish between the different ways in which a (strictly) symmetric relation applies to the things it relates. There’s no corresponding necessity to distinguish the way that the _adjacency_ relation applies to aaa and bbb when aaa is adjacent to bbb from the way that the adjacency relation applies to them when bbb is adjacent to aaa because aaa cannot be adjacent to bbb without bbb being adjacent to aaa.

Putting the ideas of the last three paragraphs together, philosophers often seek to capture what is distinctive about relations by describing them in the following manner. Unlike properties, binary relations aren’t exhibited by particulars but by _pairs_ of particulars. Similarly ternary universals aren’t exhibited by particulars but by _triples_ of particulars, etc. But, we have seen, non-symmetric relations, including asymmetrical ones, are order-sensitive. So the pairs, triples, etc., of objects that exhibit these relations must be themselves ordered. It is only ordered pairs, ordered triples, more generally, nnn\-tuples or sequences that exhibit relations (Kim 1973: 222; Chisholm 1996: 53; Loux 1998: 23).

There are a number of reasons we should be wary of characterising relations in such quasi-mathematical terms. First, sequences presuppose order, the difference between a thing’s coming first and thing’s coming second, so cannot be used to explain order without our going around in a tight circle. Second, it’s problematic to try to explain a relation between two things in terms of another thing, a sequence, which is those two things put together in an order (MacBride 2005: 590–2). If a sequence sss (\=⟨x,y⟩\=⟨x,y⟩\=\\langle x, y \\rangle) is conceived as a “one” such that a relation RRR is really only a monadic feature of it, R(s)R(s)R(s), then it’s mysterious what RRR’s holding of sss has to do with xxx and yyy being arranged one way rather than another with respect to RRR. If you don’t see the mystery straightaway, reflect that sss may have a monadic feature FFF, which is, so to speak, only to do with sss itself rather than its members. But if RRR and FFF are conceived alike, as monadic features of sss, isn’t it mysterious that the possession by sss of RRR has consequences for xxx and yyy whereas FFF doesn’t? If, alternatively, a sequence is conceived as a “many”, just xxx and yyy, such that RRR applies to them directly, then it’s unclear what the appeal to sequences has achieved.

We cannot avoid the difficulties associated with sequences by appealing to the Kuratowski definition of sequences in terms of unordered sets (where, e.g., ⟨x,y⟩\={{x},{x,y}}⟨x,y⟩\={{x},{x,y}}\\langle x, y\\rangle = \\{\\{x\\}, \\{x, y\\}\\}) (or Bergmann’s Kuratowski inspired account of order in terms of ‘diads’, see his 1981: 147). There are indefinitely many other set-theoretic constructions upon which we may rely to model sequences, e.g., Wiener’s, hence the familiar objection that we cannot legitimately fix upon any one such construction as revelatory of the nature of sequences (see Kitcher (1978: 125–6) generalising upon a point originally made by Benacerraf (1965: 54–62)). But there is also the less familiar objection that the Kuratowski definition cannot be used to analyse the order inherent in the sequence ⟨x,y⟩⟨x,y⟩\\langle x, y\\rangle. Compare: we cannot analyse personal identity in terms of memory because it’s built into the what we mean by memory that you can only remember _your own_ experiences, i.e., the very notion that we set out to explain, viz. personal identity, is presupposed by our analysans. Similarly {{x},{x,y}}{{x},{x,y}}\\{\\{x\\}, \\{x, y\\}\\} only serves as a model of ⟨x,y⟩⟨x,y⟩\\langle x, y\\rangle relative to the assumption that the thing that belongs to a singleton member, namely {x}{x}\\{x\\}, of the first class _comes first_ in the pair ⟨x,y⟩⟨x,y⟩\\langle x, y\\rangle, so the notion of order is presupposed (Hochberg 1981, 2001: 176–7).

The next idea that needs to be introduced is the idea of a _converse_ relation. For any given binary relation RRR, the converse of RRR may be defined as the relation R∗R∗R^\* that xxx bears to yyy whenever yyy bears RRR to xxx (Fine 2000: 3; van Inwagen 2006: 459). Note that the relationship between a relation and its converse isn’t a matter of happenstance; there’s no possibility of a converse of RRR floating free from RRR and holding between things independently of how RRR arranges them. Rather it’s a more intimate relationship which, if it holds, holds of necessity. For xxx to have one to yyy is, so to speak, for yyy to have the other to xxx; they neither exist nor can be observed apart from one another but can only be distinguished in thought (Geach 1957: 33). _Before_ and _after_, _above_ and _below_ are _prima facie_ examples of mutually converse relations. Non-symmetric relations, including asymmetric ones, are distinct from their converses (if they have them). Suppose RRR is a non-symmetric relation which xxx bears to y.y.y. Then the converse of RRR is borne by yyy to xxx. But suppose that RRR, as it may, fails to be borne by yyy to xxx. Then something is true of the converse of RRR that isn’t true of RRR itself, _viz._ that it is borne by yyy to xxx. Hence, the converse of RRR must be distinct from RRR. More generally, whilst a binary non-symmetric relation has only one converse, a ternary one has five mutual, distinct converses, a quadratic relation has 23 converses, etc. The issue of whether relations have converses is another issue to which we will return later.

The next distinction we will need, or more accurately, family of distinctions, is between _internal and external relations_. What makes them members of a single family is that a relation is internal if its holding between things is somehow fixed by the things themselves or how those things are; external relations are relations whose holding between things isn’t fixed this way. Different versions of the internal-external distinction correspond to different explanations of how internal relations are fixed (Ewing 1934: 118–36; Dunn 1990: 188–192; Hakkarainen, Keinänen & Keskinen, 2019). We don’t need to describe every version of the distinction but here are three that are essential to understanding the contemporary debate.

The first version of the distinction is owed to Moore. According to Moore’s (1919: 47), a binary relation RRR is internal iff if xxx bears RRR to yyy then xxx does so necessarily. From the internality of RRR, in Moore’s sense, it follows that if xxx exists at all then xxx indeed bears RRR to yyy. But if it’s possible that xxx exist whilst failing to bear RRR to yyy, then RRR is external. The doctrine of the necessity of origin provides one putative example of a relation that’s internal in Moore’s sense. If you essentially come from your biological parents then you could not have existed whilst failing to be their offspring, i.e., the relation of _biologically originating from_ must be internal in Moore’s sense.

The second version of the internal-external distinction is favoured by Armstrong (1978b: 84–5, 1989: 43, 1997: 87–9, van Inwagen 1993: 33–4). According to Armstrong, a relation RRR is internal iff it’s holding between xxx and yyy is necessitated by the intrinsic natures, i.e., non-relational properties, of xxx and yyy; otherwise RRR is external. The third version is owed to Lewis. Lewis (1986: 62) advanced the view that an internal relation is one that supervenes upon the intrinsic natures of its relata. But Lewis’s definition of “external” is more involved: RRR is external iff (1) it fails to supervene upon the nature of the relata taken separately, but (2) it does supervene on the nature of the composite of the relata taken together.

Suppose that xxx is a cube and yyy is also a cube. It follows that xxx is the same shape as y.y.y. So the relation that xxx bears to yyy when xxx is the same shape as yyy is internal in Armstrong’s sense. By contrast, spatio-temporal relations are external (in his sense) because the intrinsic characteristics of xxx and yyy don’t necessitate how close or far apart xxx and yyy are. Lewis intends his distinction to classify the same way. If xxx is the same shape as yyy, but www is not the same shape as z, then there must be some difference in intrinsic nature either between xxx and www or else between yyy and zzz. So the relation that xxx bears to yyy when xxx is the same shape as yyy is internal in Lewis’s sense. Lewis also claims that the distance between xxx and yyy is an external relation because the following conditions are met: (1) xxx may be closer to yyy than www is to zzz even though xxx is an intrinsic duplicate of www, i.e., shares all and only the same intrinsic characteristics, and yyy an intrinsic duplicate of zzz; (2) the distance between xxx and yyy does supervene upon the nature of the composite x+yx+yx+y. (We’ll return in [section 3](#ReduAbouInteRela) to the question whether, as Lewis claims, distance relation supervene upon the nature of composites.) But the relation that xxx bears to yyy when xxx is the same shape as yyy isn’t internal in Moore’s sense because, let us suppose, xxx might have been spherical whilst yyy remained a cube; so it doesn’t follow from the mere fact that xxx exists that xxx is the same shape as yyy.

The final distinction, or rather, collection of distinctions, which we’ll introduce here and which needs to be borne in mind when considering the recent debate on relations, concerns the existence and identity conditions for relations. Since Lewis it has become commonplace to conceive relations as either “abundant” or “sparse”: according to an abundant conception there is a relation for every arbitrary pair (or triple, or ...) of things whereas according to a sparse conception there are only as many relations as are required to characterise the relational aspects of likeness and difference (Lewis 1986: 61). But this binary distinction doesn’t do justice to the variety of different conceptions of the existence and identity of relations that have been put forward. Distinguish, on the one hand, an _a posterori_ view according to which relations exist only if they are instantiated and whether they are instantiated is an empirical matter (Armstrong 1978a: 76–77) from, on the other hand, an _a priori_ view according to which their existence is settled by purely logical principles, for example strong comprehension principles whereby every open formula determines a corresponding property or relation (Zalta 1988: 46–7; Williamson 2013: 226–7). Whereas the former view might admit space-time separation as a relation (or family of relations) whose instantiation is confirmed by physics, the latter would affirm the existence of a relation corresponding to the open formula “_x_ is a much funnier anarchist than _y_”. Between these two extremes are views that allow some relations, for example, relative velocities conceived as relations between different things when one has a certain velocity _relative_ to another, to be uninstantiated for the purposes of rounding out scientific theory (Bigelow and Pargetter 1990: 77) and views that allow logically complex relations (RvS, R&S _etc_.) insofar as they are built up by logical operations from simple relations (R, S _etc_.) found in nature (Bealer 1982: 9–10).

There is a considerable variety of views concerning the identity conditions for relations. Distinguish, for example, a “coarse-grained” conception, according to which relations are identical just in case they are necessarily equivalent, _i.e._ identical just in case, as a matter of necessity, they are exhibited by the same pairs, triples... of things, from a “fine-grained” conception, according to which relations are identical just in case they have the same analysis in terms of simpler relations (Bealer 1982: 2–3, Menzel 1993: 62–4). Another approach conceives relations as the same just in case they confer the same causal powers on the pairs, triples... of things related by them. A further approach to relation identity says that, for example, the dyadic relations _R_ and _S_ are identical if their corresponding relational properties (bearing _R_ to _a_, bearing _S_ to _a_ _etc._) are identical, where properties in general (which, recall, are unary) are identical just in case, according to this view, they are “encodings” of the same “abstract object”. The sense of abstract object here is a specialised one: roughly speaking, an abstract object encodes a property by encapsulating what it is to exhibit the property in question (Zalta 1988: 51–52). Even though these different conceptions of the existence and identity conditions for relations yield different results in different cases it is important to also bear in mind that they need not invariably be seen as competing. It may be that they provide different notions of relation relevant to different purposes, for example, whether we are interested in relations because of their role in causation, semantics, intentionality and so on (Lewis 1986: 55–59).

## 2\. Eliminativism, External Relations and Bradley’s Regress

Some philosophers are wary of admitting relations because they are difficult to locate. Glasgow is west of Edinburgh. This tells us something about the locations of these two cities. But where is the relation that holds between them in virtue of which Glasgow is west of Edinburgh? The relation can’t be in one city at the expense of the other, nor in each of them taken separately, since then we lose sight of the fact that the relation holds between _them_ (McTaggart 1920: §80). Rather the relation must somehow share the divided locations of Glasgow and Edinburgh without itself being divided. This may sound peculiar if we assume that middle-sized things like cities, which have locations in a relatively straightforward sense, set a standard for how entities in general ought to behave. But why shouldn’t we admit other kinds of entity that have a different kind of relationship to space and time from such readily located things. Or even go down the route of conceiving relations as abstract, i.e., as “Nowhere and nowhen” (Russell 1912: 55–6). As Lewis reflected, “if the price is right, we could learn to tolerate it” (Lewis 1986: 68). But is the price right? Do the theoretical benefits of admitting relations outweigh the cost of offending pre-theoretic intuition?

Other philosophers have been wary of admitting relations because, they complain, relations are unsatisfactorily characterised, “neither fish nor fowl”, i.e., neither substances nor attributes (Heil 2012: 141, 2016: 130) or "ontologically weird" (Lowe 2016: 111). Now it’s certainly true that nnn\-adic relations, where n\>1n\>1n\\gt 1, cannot be characterised as either substances or (monadic) attributes. But it only follows that relations are unsatisfactorily characterised if we assume that substances and attributes provide the benchmark for satisfactory characterisation. But we shouldn’t assume this ahead of investigating whether the theoretical benefits of admitting relations outweigh the costs. It’s also been complained that relations are suspect because they _depend_ upon the existence of substances that bear them (Campbell 1990: 108–9) or, as Lowe makes the point, “A ‘relational accident’, if there could be such a thing would not be ‘in’, to at least not be wholly ‘in’, any of its two or more ‘subjects’, nor even wholly ‘in’ the totality of them. I consequently find it hard to conceive what such an entity could really be” (Lowe 2016: 111–2). Of course it’s true that in order for a relation to be borne by one thing to another thing, then those things must exist. But it doesn’t follow that relations don’t exist if nothing bears them. Moreover, it doesn’t follow straightaway from the reflection that to be borne by something a relation needs things to bear it, that relations are suspect. It doesn’t follow any more than it follows from the reflection that to be had by something an attribute needs things to have it, that attributes are suspect. If the price is right we should open our minds to the possibility of things which are neither fish nor fowl but vegetables, i.e., neither substances nor attributes but relations.

In light of the internal/external distinction introduced above, we can distinguish two distinct questions here: (a) should we acknowledge external relations? (b) should we acknowledge internal relations? In the present section our focus will be upon whether to accept or reject external relations, before turning to internal relations in the next.

F.H. Bradley regarded himself the nemesis of external relations, but not only them. Famously, Bradley brought a vicious regress argument against external relations. In his original version (1893: 32–3), Bradley presented a dilemma to show that external relations are unintelligible. Here’s the dilemma. Either a relation RRR is _nothing_ to the things aaa and bbb it relates, in which case it cannot relate them. Or, it is _something_ to them, in which case RRR must be related to them. But for RRR to be related to aaa and bbb there must be not only RRR and the things it relates, but also a subsidiary relation R′R′R' to relate RRR to them. But now the same problem arises with regard to R′R′R'. It must be something to RRR and the things it related in order for R′R′R' to relate RRR to them and this requires a further subsidiary relation R′′R″R'' between R′R′R', RRR, aaa and bbb. But positing more relations to fix up the problem is only throwing good money after bad. We fall into an infinite regress because the same reasoning applies equally to R′R′R' and however many other subsidiary relations we subsequently introduce—this is commonly called “Bradley”s Regress’. As Bradley later summed up,

> “while we keep to our terms and relation as external, no introduction of a third factor could help us to anything better than an endless renewal of our failure” (Bradley 1935: 643; van Inwagen 1993: 35–6).

So whichever horn of Bradley’s dilemma we choose, whether a relation RRR is nothing or something to the things it relates, we cannot make sense of RRR relating them. Bradley concluded that we should eliminate external relations from our ontology.

It is often claimed that Bradley’s eliminativism may be addressed by positing a special category of entities, either (1) facts (Hochberg 1978: 338–40; Armstrong 1989: 109–110, 1997: 118–9; Hossack 2007: 41–5) or (2) tropes (Maurin 2010: 321–3; Simons 2010: 201–3). The strategic idea they share is that we can embrace the second horn of Bradley’s dilemma without being stymied by his regress argument. Bradley assumed external relations to be _general_ entities, i.e., universals, capable of relating different things from whatever things they happen to actually relate. It follows from this assumption that the mere existence of RRR and the things it relates cannot suffice for RRR to relate them, because RRR might have been engaged elsewhere relating other things, and this problem will persist however many subsidiary (universal) RRRs we introduce. But, it is argued, this problem can be avoided by either positing facts or tropes, which are particular rather than general entities. Both of these purported solutions are open to question. It seems that they presuppose what they set out to show: the capacity of relations to relate (MacBride 2011: 168–72). Why is this?

First, take (1): Hochberg, Armstrong and Hossack argue that the fact that aRbaRba\\Rel b does indeed suffice for RRR to hold between aaa and bbb, because the fact that aRbaRba\\Rel b cannot exist unless RRR does hold between aaa and bbb. So once the fact that aRbaRba\\Rel b has been admitted into our ontology, the later stages of Bradley’s regress either don’t arise or they harmlessly supervene upon the admission of this fact. But, MacBride counters, this presupposes that Bradley’s argument has already been disarmed. Ask yourself: what is a fact? What distinguishes the fact that aRbaRba\\Rel b from the mere plurality of its constituents: RRR, aaa, bbb? Just this: that the constituents of the fact are _related._ But Bradley’s argument is intended to establish that we cannot understand how it is possible for things to be _related_. So unless we have already established where Bradley’s argument goes wrong, we cannot appeal to the existence of facts because facts are cast into doubt by his argument too.

Next, take (2). Maurin and Simons argue that if we reject Bradley’s assumption that relations are general entities, i.e. universals, and hold instead that relations are a special class of particular entities, i.e., non-transferable tropes, then we can avoid Bradley’s Regress. What is a relation conceived as a “non-transferable trope”? It’s a relation r1r1r\_1 that’s borne essentially by the things it relates and which could not have been borne by anything else (Simons 2002/3: 6). Suppose r1r1r\_1 is borne by aaa to bbb. Then r1r1r\_1 is a trope in the sense that it is non-repeatable and so is not a “one-over many”, not a universal. And r1r1r\_1 is non-transferable in the sense that it could not be transferred from one pair of particulars to another, i.e., r1r1r\_1 could not be borne by ccc to ddd where c≠ac≠ac \\ne a and d≠bd≠bd \\ne b. So, necessarily, if r1r1r\_1 exists then (i) aaa and bbb exist and (ii) ar1bar1ba\\mathbin{r\_1} b. So in virtue of the manner in which r1r1r\_1 depends upon the things it relates it follows that the mere existence of r1r1r\_1 accounts for aaa and bbb’s being related without having to go down the route of appealing to subsidiary relations to glue them together. But again, this proposal assumes that relations really do relate, and therefore that Bradley’s regress has already been disarmed. By way of analogy, consider the Problem of Evil: the difficulty of theoretically squaring God’s omnipotence, omniscience, omnibenevolence, etc., with the (apparent) fact of unnecessary evil in the world. Of course if God exists then there cannot be any unnecessary evil, i.e., there must be a solution to the Problem of Evil. But we don’t provide a theoretical solution to the Problem by simply positing God. That doesn’t make any easier the theoretical task of squaring what appears to be unnecessary evil with the nature of an omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent deity. Similarly we don’t provide an effective theoretical response to Bradley’s argument by simply positing relational tropes. Positing them doesn’t provide an explanation of how a relation can succeed in relating some things without requiring to be related by a further relation to them.

Bradley’s problem with relations would be resolved if we could achieve a perspective whereby we appreciated that the bearing of a relation isn’t itself a relation or require a further relation, whatever grammar may suggest (Armstrong 1978a: 106–111; Grossman 1983: 167–8; Lewis 2002: 6–7). But we won’t achieve that perspective until we can provide a diagnosis of Bradley’s reasoning that relieves us of the temptation to think that the bearing of a relation is itself a relation.

Bertrand Russell dismissed Bradley’s argument on the grounds that philosophers who disbelieve in the reality of external relations cannot possibly interpret those numerous parts of sciences which appear to be committed to external relations (Russell 1924: 339). Russell’s argument bears comparison to Quine’s famous indispensability argument for mathematics: just as we cannot make sense of scientific discourse without taking seriously those portions irredeemably committed to, e.g., numbers, we cannot make sense of scientific discourse without taking seriously those portions committed to, e.g., spatio-temporal relations (Quine 1981: 149–50). From a methodological point of view, Russell deemed it more likely that an error is concealed somewhere in Bradley’s argument than that modern science should have incorporated so fundamental a falsehood, i.e., portrayed a world of spatio-temporal relations when really there are none. Of course even if we have good or even overwhelming reason to think that Bradley’s argument must be wrong, this doesn’t relieve us of the philosophical responsibility of determining where exactly Bradley slipped up.

## 3\. Reductionism about Internal Relations

What about internal relations? Do we need to acknowledge their existence? We distinguished 3 senses of “internal relation” in our preliminary discussion: internal relations are determined by the mere existence of the things they relate, or internal relations are determined by the intrinsic characters of the things they relate, or internal relations supervene upon the intrinsic characters of the things they relate. So, in one sense or another, it suffices for the obtaining of an internal relation that either the things it relates exist or that the things it relates have such-and-such intrinsic characters. On this basis, some philosophers have concluded that there is no need to admit internal relations as additional pieces of furniture in the Universe (Fisk 1972: 146–9; Armstrong 1978b: 86; Campbell 1990: 99–101; Simons 2010: 204–5; 2014: 314–5; Lowe 2013: 242, 2016: 105–6; Heil 2009: 316–7, 2012: 144–6, 2016: 130, Lowe 2016:102–11, Keinänen 2020). Why do they think this? Truths about internal relations aren’t necessarily equivalent to truths about the things they relate or the intrinsic characters of the things they relate. Nevertheless, all the truths about internal relations are determined by the existence or the intrinsic characters of the things they relate, or supervene upon them. So internal relations are variously declared to be “no addition of being” (Armstrong) or “absent from the fundamental ontology” (Heil) or, more clearly, “there are no such things” (Simons).

Consider an example:

1.  Ben Vorlich, a Scottish mountain, is taller than Ben Vane, its neighbour.
2.  Ben Vorlich is 3094 ft high whilst Ben Vane is 3002 ft.

(1) and (2) aren’t necessarily equivalent because Ben Vorlich might have been taller than Ben Vane even if Ben Vorlich and Ben Vane had had different heights from the ones they actually have, i.e., (2) doesn’t follow from (1). Nevertheless, Ben Vorlich’s being taller than Ben Vane is determined by its having the height it does (3094 ft) and Ben Vane’s having the height it does (3002 ft); it isn’t possible for these mountains to have the heights they do whilst Ben Vorlich fail to be taller than Ben Vane. So the _being taller than_ relation is internal in Armstrong’s sense. This relation is also internal in Lewis’s sense which, recall, relies upon comparison between pairs of a relation’s relata (Lewis 1986: 62). Ben Lomond doesn’t stand to Ben More as Ben Vorlich does to Ben Vane, because Ben Lomond is 3196 ft, Ben More, 3852 ft. Hence Ben Vorlich’s being taller than Ben Vane supervenes, in Lewis’s sense, upon the heights of Ben Vorlich and Ben Vane. So once Ben Vorlich and Ben Vane have been bestowed with their respective heights there is no need to admit a further (internal) relation to account for Ben Vorlich’s being taller than Ben Vane (Campbell 1990: 100, 103; Lewis 1994: 294).

This, broadly speaking, reductionist argument is open to question in a variety of respects. Some philosophers have maintained that it cannot be effective because we literally perceive proportions and other internal relations (Mulligan 1991; Hochberg 2013: 232). These relations must exist, otherwise we couldn’t perceive them. So, they conclude, something must have gone wrong with this argument because it leads to the mistaken conclusion that there aren’t any internal relations out there to be perceived.

More generally, this reductionist argument assumes that if an internal relation RRR isn’t required to perform the role of determining that RRR holds between the things it relates, because that role has already been discharged by the intrinsic characteristics of the things it relates, then RRR doesn’t exist at all or doesn’t constitute “an addition to the world’s furniture” (Armstrong 1997: 87). But from the fact that RRR doesn’t fulfill one role it doesn’t follow that it isn’t required to fulfill another. It doesn’t follow because there may still be other good reasons for us to believe that internal relations exist, or constitute “an addition to the world’s furniture”.

To bring the issues here into focus we will need to take on board two further distinctions. First, the distinction between _truth-making_ and _ontological commitment_. A truth-maker for a statement SSS is (at least) something the existence of which determines (necessitates) that SSS is true (Armstrong 2004: 5–7). By contrast, something xxx is an ontological commitment of SSS if, roughly speaking, SSS could not be true unless xxx existed (Quine 169: 95). Typically, a statement SSS incurs ontological commitment to an entity or some entities because we refer to it or quantify over them when we make the statement. It’s easy to run _truth-making_ and _ontological commitment_ together but it’s important to keep them separate. A statement SSS cannot be true unless the entities to which SSS is ontologically committed exist. So it’s a _necessary_ condition of the truth of SSS that the entities to which SSS is ontologically committed exist. By contrast, it’s a _sufficient_ condition for the truth of SSS that a truth-maker for SSS exist because a truth-maker for SSS determines that SSS is true.

Armed with the distinction between truth-making and ontological commitment, we are now able to state a very general shortcoming of the argument. Let it be agreed that Ben Vorlich’s being the height it is and Ben Vane’s being the height it is together make true the claim that Ben Vorlich is taller than Ben Vane; so no further truth-makers are required for this claim to be true. But it doesn’t follow that we aren’t ontologically committed to the existence of an internal relation between Ben Vorlich and Ben Vane when we make this claim. We surely are ontologically committed to Ben Vorlich and Ben Vane when we make the claim that one is taller than the other even though they’re not themselves truth-makers for this claim. They’re not truth-makers for this claim because they might have existed even though Ben Vane was taller than Ben Vorlich or the same height. But recognising that the class of ontological commitments and the class of truth-makers for a given claim may be different classes opens up the possibility that we may be ontologically committed to an internal relation between Ben Vorlich and Ben Vane even though this relation isn’t a truthmaker for this claim either (MacBride 2011: 162–6).

The second distinction we need is between _thick_ and _thin_ relations (Mulligan 1998: 342–7). Some examples. Thick relations: _loves_, _kills_, _gives_. Thin relations: _identity_, _resemblance_, _greater than_. Thick relations have more of a “material” content and are less “formal” than thin relations. It correspondingly makes more sense to think of thick relations as “topic-neutral”. Thin relations, by contrast to thick relations, are typically internal (see Clementz 2014 and Johansson 2014 for further discussion of the thick/thin distinction).

We are now equipped state another, more specific gap in the reductionist argument. Whilst Ben Vorlich and Ben Vane’s having the heights they do avoids the need to admit the existence of a thick (internal) relation that Ben Vorlich bears to Ben Vane, this doesn’t avoid the need to admit the existence of a thin (internal) relation. This is because we need to explain why Ben Vorlich’s having the height it does (3094 ft) and Ben Vane’s having the height it does (3004 ft) entails that Ben Vorlich is taller than Ben Vane. The answer is that the thin relation _being greater than_ holds between the number of feet in height that Ben Vorlich has and the number of feet in height that Ben Vane has (Russell 1903: §214; Bigelow & Pargetter 1990: 55–6. So internal relations may not (in general) be required to perform the role of truth-makers for comparative claims. Nonetheless thin internal relations may perform an indispensable role in explaining why the truth-makers for comparative claims are equipped to make such claims true, rather than leaving this a matter of brute inexplicable necessity—because, in this case, the heights of the mountains in question lie in a certain relation of proportion to one another. Similarly Ben Vorlich’s being taller than Ben Vane’s supervenes upon their heights but this is only intelligible because the height of Ben Vorlich is larger than the height of Ben Vane.

This leaves us a choice. Either we can rewind the argument and admit internal relations, whether thick or thin, as additions to the world’s furniture (Bigelow & Pargetter 1990: 56–60). Or we can adopt the more austere view that only admits thin (internal) relations to hold amongst intrinsic characteristics (Mulligan 1998: 347).

The situation may be summed up in schematic terms. There are true comparative claims of the form aRbaRba\\Rel b which are either determined to be true by, or supervene upon, the intrinsic natures of the things they relate, Fa&GbFa&GbFa \\amp Gb. Philosophers of a reductionist persuasion have argued that this shows there is no need to admit an internal relation (R)(R)(R) over and above the intrinsic characteristics or monadic foundations of the things related (F,G)(F,G)(F, G). But the intrinsic characteristics of the things related only determine the truth of the claim that aRbaRba\\Rel b, or the truth of the claim that aRbaRba\\Rel b only supervenes upon Fa&GbFa&GbFa \\amp Gb, because these characteristics stand in an internal relation themselves, FRGFRGF \\fR G. Because the monadic foundations, FaFaFa and GbGbGb, are only empowered to determine that aRbaRba\\Rel b because FFF and GGG lie in this internal relation, RR\\fR, it follows that internal relations still perform an indispensable role in our theorising about the world. One line of response to this argument is to deny that the ontological commitments and the truth-makers for a claim might come apart by defining ontological commitment in terms of truth making, by roughly speaking, maintaining that to be is to be a truth-maker, but then an alternative theory of truth will need to be provided for ordinary and formal languages if quantificational structure is never ontologically committing and it unclear whether this can be done (Heil 2016: 129; MacBride 2018: 157).

The case against reductionism about internal relations has proceeded so far from a relatively _a priori_ basis. But there’s also a case to be made against it on _a posteriori_ grounds. Grant for the sake of argument the claim that if a relation is internal then it doesn’t count as an ontological addition. The significance of this claim, when it comes to providing an inventory of the world’s furniture, depends upon the extent to which relational truths have monadic foundations. But relativity theory, quantum theory and even classical mechanics provide an _a posteriori_ basis for doubting that there are very many, if any, FFFs and GGGs capable of serving as monadic foundations for target RRRs, i.e., intrinsic properties to which a significant range of relations may be reduced.

It is often taken for granted by metaphysicians that the fundamental quantities of physics provide a ready source of monadic foundations because physical quantities are intrinsic characteristics. The vision of reality metaphysicians typically ascribe to physics is akin to Lewis’s doctrine of “Humean Supervenience”, according to which there are intrinsic properties which need nothing bigger than a point to be instantiated and there’s no difference without a difference in the arrangement of intrinsic properties over points (Lewis 1986: ix–xvi). And certainly some metaphysicians have endeavoured to make good upon this vision, arguing, for example, that velocity is an intrinsic property (Tooley 1988; Bigelow & Pargetter 1990: 62–82). But not only is this view contentious, there are many other notions in classical mechanics, such as force, stress, strain and elasticity, represented using vectors and tensors, that belie the conception of fundamental physical quantities as intrinsic (Butterfield 2006, 2011).

When we turn from classical mechanics to relativity theory and quantum theory, the _a posteriori_ case against conceiving physical quantities as intrinsic is even stronger. Consider mass and charge, most metaphysicians’ favourite and commonly relied upon examples of intrinsic properties of a piece of matter (in particular a point particle). In relativity theory, mass is identified with energy (“mass-energy”). In a relativistic field theory, such as Maxwell’s theory of electromagnetism, the all-pervading electromagnetic field has mass-energy. It also has momentum, stress and other traditionally mechanical properties. So mass is no longer conceived as an intrinsic property of localized lumps of stuff, let alone of point particles. Furthermore, the attribution of mass, momentum, stress, etc., to the electromagnetic field, or to a matter field such as a continuous fluid, depends upon the metrical structure of spacetime. So these quantities are not intrinsic, but, rather, relational properties. They are properties that the radiation or matter field in question has in virtue of its relation to spacetime structure (Lehmkuhl 2011).

In quantum theory there are even fewer candidates for intrinsic properties. Even in elementary quantum mechanics, the closest analogue of a point particle as classically understood (“a quantum particle”) is an all-pervading field, _viz_. an assignment, for each instant of time, of a (complex) number to every point of space. Here, the mass of the quantum particle cannot be attributed to any single point of space, but must be associated with the whole field, although not in the simple manner of “spreading the mass out” as a classical mass density distribution. (The same remark applies to the quantum particle’s charge.) Turning to quantum field theory: here again, the notion of particle is radically changed from the idea of a classical point particle _and_ from the idea of a quantum particle. There are not various quantum particles, each of them represented by a complex-valued field as above, and each of them, say, electrons. Rather there is a single all-pervading _electron field_ and each electron, as treated in elementary quantum mechanics, is replaced by a unit of energetic excitation of the electron field. The same goes for other types of matter, such as quarks. According to quantum field theory, quarks are really excitations of an all-pervading quark field. Besides, quantum field theory exhibits a second, and fundamentally different, way in which mass and charge fail to be intrinsic properties. This goes under the label of “renormalization”. In short, the mass and charge of a particle _à la_ quantum field theory, i.e., a unit of excitation of an all-pervading field, depends upon the length-scale at which you choose to describe, or to experimentally probe, the field (Butterfield 2014, 2015).

So, to sum up this case against reductionism about relations: there seem to be far fewer (if any) monadic physical properties than the reductionist view needs. But this it is not the only case that has been made. It has also been argued on the basis of quantum entanglement, the fact that the quantum states of entangled particles cannot be described independently of one another, that physics is committed to relations that don’t supervene upon intrinsic properties (Teller 1986). More radically, it has been argued that a consideration of quantum entanglement pushes us towards the metaphysical outlook that there are no intrinsic properties (Esfeld 2004, 2016) or even that there are no objects but only relations (French & Ladyman 2003; Ladyman & Ross 2007: 130–89, Ladyman 2016; for objections see Psillos 2001, 2006, Brinceño & Mumford 2016).

Consider next the related suggestion that spatio-temporal relations are internal relations between, variously, space-time points, regions or events (Simons 2010: 207–8, 2014: 312–4; Simons 2016: 2010: 207–8; Heil 2012: 147; Lowe 2016: 109–111). General relativity makes serious trouble for this suggestion. The thinking behind the suggestion is that it belongs to the essential natures of space-time points, etc., that they bear the catalogue of spatio-temporal relations they do. In philosophy of physics, the view is called “metrical essentialism”, the doctrine that points have their metrical properties and relations essentially (Maudlin 1988). From metrical essentialism it follows that the mere existence of a point, etc., already suffices to determine that it inhabits this network of spatio-temporal relations. Hence, it is argued, there is no need to admit spatio-temporal relations, or at least consider spatio-temporal relations as ontological additions to the furniture of the Universe. But, as well as the _a priori_ concerns already aired, this argument for refusing to admit spatio-temporal relations as ontological additions is encumbered by the _a posteriori_ difficulties of the metrical essentialism it presupposes.

These difficulties for metrical essentialism arise from the fact that in general relativity space-time structure varies from one model, i.e., possible world, to another (Butterfield 1989: 16–27). We cannot leave points or regions to themselves to settle their internal relations, because general relativity denies the idea of a spatial-temporal framework whose make-up is settled independently of the matter or radiation. So there isn’t a stable once-and-for-all class of points or regions which once posited suffice for the purposes of modern physics, hence no stable class of truth-makers that suffice for making all the distance-duration claims true.

It may help to understand this debate about space-time points if we consider the following line of response on behalf of metrical essentialism. According to metrical essentialism, points have their metrical properties and relations, i.e., space-time framework, essentially. So if the space-time framework differs between models then the points must differ between models too. But this view isn’t compromised by the fact, as Butterfield (1989) points out, that in general relativity the space-time framework varies from one model to another; it only follows that the points must vary between these models too. What, however, this line of response fails to take into account is how extremely fragile spatio-temporal relations must be conceived to be when metrical essentialism is combined with general relativity.

Take a possible world which is truly described by a dynamical theory of space-time (i.e., described by general relativity and any likely successor to it). Now take a second possible world which differs from the first only with respect to a tiny change, on a millimeter scale as regards length, and on a milligram scale as regards mass. This involves altering spatio-temporal relations throughout the entire universe. Hence it’s a consequence of metrical essentialism that in the second possible world, all space-time points are non-identical to those in the first. But surely it’s implausible that such a small adjustment should add up to such a world-altering difference (thanks here to Jeremy Butterfield).

We are now in a position to evaluate David Lewis’s claim that whilst distance relations fail to supervene on the intrinsic characters of the things they relate, there is nevertheless a different way in which relations of distance do supervene on intrinsic character:

> If, instead of taking a duplicate of the electron and a duplicate of the proton, we take a duplicate of the whole atom, then it will exhibit the same electron-proton distance as the original atom. Although distance fails to supervene on the intrinsic nature of the relata taken separately, it does supervene on the intrinsic nature of the composite of the relata taken together – in this case the composite hydrogen atom. (1986: 62)

This remark has suggested to some philosophers that we can do away with relations generally because we need only posit the composites upon whose intrinsic nature the relation supervenes (Parsons 2009: 223–5). But Lewis’s view and the more general form of reductionism inspired by it encounter a dilemma. Either (1) the composite is just the proton and electron taken together. But then the distance between them fails to supervene upon the intrinsic character of the composite, because there are duplicates of the proton and duplicates of the electron that vary in distance. Or (2) the composite is more than just the proton and electron, i.e., the proton and electron related together in some (external) way. But then we haven’t gotten rid of external relations in favour of internal ones but only presupposed them.

Can this dilemma for Lewis be sidestepped by the following manoeuvre? Suppose the composite is the mereological fusion of the proton and the electron. Then can’t we say that the fusion has its intrinsic character, and the distance relation between the parts of the fusion supervenes on this character?

But this can’t be enough to say. We don’t really have any idea of what the intrinsic properties of fusions are because the axioms of mereology are silent about the intrinsic characters of fusions. So we don’t really have any idea of whether the distance relations of their parts supervene upon their properties. Perhaps fusions don’t have much, if any, intrinsic character! Since we don’t know much about these things, we’re not in a position to rule out the possibility of a duplicate of Lewis’s proton-electron fusion being a fusion that has parts which are a different distance apart than the original proton and electron Lewis described.

Of course, there’s no logical bar to putting forward a theory that posits a rich supply of fusions whose intrinsic natures are such that the distance relations that hold between the parts of these fusions supervenes upon their intrinsic characters. But why believe such a theory? It’s difficult to see how the supervenience of distance relations upon intrinsic characters of fusions could ever be explained (’superdupervenience’), because it’s difficult to see how an intrinsic property FFF of one thing XXX can intelligibly give rise to an external relation RRR between two other things xxx and yyy, even if xxx and yyy are parts of XXX.

Finally, in the light of the foregoing discussion, Lewis’s view is open to an objection from physics: there is no absolute fact of the matter about the distance between the electron and proton independently of facts about the physical fields more generally, e.g., the electromagnetic field and the electron field, i.e., facts concerning what is happening elsewhere. So the distance relation of the electron and fusion cannot supervene upon the intrinsic character of the proton-electron fusion. It follows that distance relations cannot be external in Lewis’s sense.

## 4\. The Nature of Relations: Order and Direction

Supposing they exist, what is the nature of relations, whether internal or external? It is the crucial feature of binary non-symmetric relations, which distinguishes them from binary symmetric relations, or, more generally, distinguishes relations which fail to be strictly symmetric from strictly symmetric ones, that they bestow order upon the things they relate. Non-symmetric relations do so, because they admit of _differential application_, i.e., for any such relation there are multiple ways in which it potentially applies to the things it relates. So, in particular, for every binary non-symmetric RRR, aRb≠bRaaRb≠bRaa\\Rel b \\ne b\\Rel a. But can we say anything more about how it is possible for non-symmetric relations to admit of differential application? More generally, can we say anything discursive about the origins of order?

According to what is sometimes called the “standard” account of non-symmetric relations, we can (Russell 1903: §94; Grossman 1983: 164; Paul 2012: 251–2). A non-symmetrical relation RRR has a _direction_ whereby it travels _from_ one thing _to_ another. What distinguishes aRbaRba\\Rel b from bRabRab\\Rel a is that RRR runs from aaa to bbb in the former case and bbb to aaa in the latter. So differential application is possible because non-symmetric relations have direction, i.e., because non-symmetric relations run one way, rather than another, amongst the things they relate. (See Johansson 2011 for an argument that ‘direction’ is really a cluster term covering different logical and intentional notions.)

The standard account faces the serious objection that it is liable to _over-generate_ relations, specifically converse ones, giving rise to an _over-abundance_ of states that results from the holding of converse relations (Fine 2000: 2–5; cf. Russell 1913: 85–7; Castañeda 1975: 239–40; Armstrong 1978b: 42, 94; for related puzzles arising out of the commitments of Armstrong 1997, see Hochberg 1999: 157–60, Cross 2000 and Newman 2002). Employing the notion of _direction_ that the standard account uses to explain order, we can define the converse of a non-symmetric RRR as the relation R∗R∗R^\* that runs from bbb to aaa whenever RRR runs from aaa to bbb. But once given this notion of a (distinct) converse, it is difficult to deny that RRR has a converse. This is because it would be arbitrary to admit the existence of RRR whilst denying its converse (or _vice versa_). Hence, the standard view is committed to the general principle,

(_Converses_) Every non-symmetric relation has a distinct converse.

But the admission of converse relations threatens to conflict with two plausible sounding principles about the number of states that arise from the holding of non-symmetric relations and their converses.

(_Identity_) Any state that arises from the holding of a relation RRR is identical to a state that arises from the holding of its converse R∗R∗R^\*.

(_Uniqueness_) No one state arises from the holding of more than one relation.

Support for _Identity_ is garnered from intuitions: that the cat’s being _on top of_ the mat is the very same state as the mat’s being _underneath_ the cat, that Obama’s being _taller_ than Putin is the very same state as Putin’s being _shorter_ than Obama, and so on. _Uniqueness_ is based upon more overtly theoretical grounds. States are often conceived as complexes of things, properties and relations. They are, so to speak, metaphysical molecules built up from their constituents, so states built up from different things or properties or relations cannot be identical. Hence it cannot be the case that the holding of two distinct relations give rise to the same state.

Now _one_ problem with the standard view is that _Converses_, _Identity_ and _Uniqueness_ form an inconsistent triad, assuming there are non-symmetric relations. Take the cat’s being on top of the mat. _Identity_ dictates that this state is the very same state as the mat’s being under the cat. But if there is only one state in play here, _Uniqueness_ tells us that this state can only arise from the holding of one relation. So the relation that holds between the cat and the mat in virtue of which the cat is on top of the mat must be identical to the relation that holds between the cat and the mat in virtue of which the mat is underneath the cat. But this conflicts with _Converses_ which tells us these relations are distinct.

In the face of this inconsistency a number of theoretical options are open to us. If we wish to maintain the standard view that non-symmetric relations have direction then something has to give. (1) Either we can give up _Identity_, _Uniqueness,_ or both, or we can ditch _Converses_. Indeed it has been argued that _Converses_ should be ditched anyway because it gives rise to a special kind of semantic indeterminacy: we cannot establish by our use of a sign for a binary non-symmetric relation RRR that we mean to pick _it_ out rather than its converse R∗R∗R^\*. This is because we can shift the referent of a predicate from a given relation to its converse whilst leaving undisturbed the truth conditions of the statement in which the predicate occurs by making compensating adjustments to the manner in which the names flanking the predicate are interpreted (Williamson 1985: 252–55, 1987; van Inwagen 2006: 458–68 but see Liebesman 2013 for a reply to Williamson). But whether _Converses_ is ditched to avoid semantic indeterminacy, or because _Converses_, _Identity_ and _Uniqueness_ form an inconsistent triad, or for some other reason, the link between _Converses_ and the standard view will have to be broken. (2) Alternatively we can jettison _Converses_ but throw out the standard view with it. But if that’s the option we choose, then we will have to go back to the drawing board to provide a fresh account of differential application that doesn’t appeal to direction.

There is certainly room for development if we go down route (1). The intuitions that provide evidence for _Identity_ are, like intuitions generally, considered by many philosophers to be relatively weak sources of evidence, because there may be all variety of psychological, historical and sociological forces responsible for our holding this or that view to be intuitive which have little to do with whether the view is true or credible. There’s also a tradition of conceiving states or facts as capable of being analysed into more than one collection of constituents, i.e., a tradition that denies _Uniqueness_ (Frege 1884: §64; Hodes 1982; see Macbride 2007: 54–55 and Liebesman 2014 for counterarguments to Fine’s assumption; but see Leo 2013 for a view which denies _uniqueness_ for states).

Alternatively we may leave _Identity_ and _Uniqueness_ in place but question whether the standard view really does give rise to _Converses_. According to one line of thought (Russell 1913: 86–7), it would be arbitrary for us to choose from the inside, so to speak, one binary non-symmetric relation at the expense of its converse. But, it may be argued, this doesn’t preclude nature choosing for us from the outside, providing an externalist rather than an internalist foundation for admitting a non-symmetric relation but not its converse. Nevertheless, even if _Converses_ is ditched there is another obstacle to the standard view, namely that it appears to give rise to questions about direction for which there are no sensible answers, even if doesn’t over-generate converse relations and states to house them (MacBride 2014: 5–7, 9–10). Consider the states, (a) Antony is married to Fulvia and (b) Antony is to the left of Fulvia. If these states arise from their respective relations travelling from one thing they relate to another, then there must be a fact of the matter about which things proceed from and which to. So, we may ask, do they both proceed from the same thing or do they proceed from different things? It doesn’t seem that there could be a sensible answer to this question and so we should avoid an account of differential application that commits us to there being such recherché and undetectable facts of the matter. (But note that whilst many philosophers have felt the pull of these kind of intuitive considerations, others have argued that is is necessary to introduce ordinal properties or relations to impose structure upon relational facts. For example, Hochberg posits “ordering relations” (Hochberg 1987, 1999: 180–81) whilst Tegtmeier posits “ordinators”, such as “coming first” and “coming second” in a fact (Tegtmeier 1990, 2004, 2016).)

What are the options if we go down route (2)? Some philosophers have suggested that if we ditch _Converses_ then we will have to give up non-symmetric relations altogether (van Inwagen 2006: 453). But this presupposes that the only way to account for the distinctive feature of non-symmetric relations, _viz._ differential application, is to appeal to the standard view. However, philosophers that go down this second route endeavour to account for differential application by different means than _direction_ and thereby earn the right to hold onto non-symmetric relations. We can distinguish three broad strategies for explaining differential application without direction, namely (1) _positionalism_, (2) _anti-positionalism_, and (3) _primitivism_, although this does not exhaust the range of possibilities considered in the literature (consider, for example, the view that relations are properties of sequences discussed above (sec. 1).

First, _positionalism_ may be roughly sketched as the view that an nnn\-ary relation has nnn argument positions, where argument positions are conceived as themselves entities, and, crucially, there is no intrinsic order to the argument places of a relation; neither argument position of a binary relation is the first or the second, etc. (Castañeda 1972, 1975; Williamson 1985: 257; Grossman 1992: 57; Armstrong 1997: 90–1; Cross 2002: 219–223, Fine 2000: 10–16; Orilia 2011; Gilmore 2013). In the case of a binary non-symmetric relation RRR, this amounts to the idea that RRR is associated with two further entities, % and #, its argument positions, and RRR holds between two given relata aaa and bbb relative to an assignment of objects to % and #. The difference between aRbaRba\\Rel b and bRabRab\\Rel a (differential application) is then explained in terms of the different relative assignments of aaa and bbb to % and #: aaa to % and bbb to # in one case, and bbb to % and aaa to # in the other. But since the argument positions do not themselves exhibit any significant order or direction, there is no basis here for introducing converses, i.e., relations that differ only with respect to their direction of travel.

Different versions of _positionalism_ vary with regard to (i)(i)(i) the nature of argument positions, crucially upon whether they can be shared by different relations, and (ii)(ii)(ii) the variety of argument positions, whether there are different kinds of position specifically suited to different kinds of relata, and (iii)(iii)(iii) the complexity of the relation whereby things are assigned to positions. According to Orilia’s _onto-thematic role_ view, positions are capable of recurring in different relations and suited by their nature to different sorts of filling (Orilia 2011, 2014, Paolini Paoletti 2016, 2018b sec. 2, and for an earlier version inspired by Leibniz, Orilia 2008). For example, the _loves_ relation has agent and patient roles, roles which also recur in the _hates_ relation. Other more complex relations involve more and different roles, for example, theme, location, instrument, goal _etc_. Orilia’s idea is that the schedule of ontological roles belonging to relations should be informed by the linguistic programme of identifying thematic roles in natural language because this helps us to provide informative generalisations about what different relations have in common (see Davis 2011 for a helpful introduction to the thematic role literature in linguistics).

By contrast, other versions of _positionalism_ conceive of positions as unique to the relations in which they figure. Some positionalists of this stripe conceives of each position as being assigned a unique occupant (Gilmore 2013). But others whilst sharing the assumption that positions are unique to the relations in which they figure, also maintain that it is a mistake to assume that there is a 1-1 correspondence between positions and their occupants. So this version of positonalism conceives relations more liberally as having positions capable of being assigned several distinct occupants at once (see, for example, Armstrong 1997: 91, Yi 1999: 169; Fine 2000: 17, MacBride 2005: 588). Further sophistication is added by the idea that positions can be occupied by a number of things varying between fixed limits (Hazen&Taylor 1992: 376, 390, Dixon 2018: 207) and by the suggestion that the assignment of things to positions should also be relative to a number to allow for one and the same thing to simultaneously occur more than once in the same position (Dixon 2018: 213–6).

A different line is taken by Donnelly’s _relative positionalism_, according to which positions are a kind of “relative property” (Donnelly 2016). Donnelly takes _being north_ as an example of a relative property: a property because it is had by one thing but only relative to something else, in this case a location. Her basic idea is that corresponding to each _n_\-ary relation _R_ is a package of relative properties (as many as _n_ factorial properties) such that when _n_ things instantiate R they instantiate these properties relative to one another (Donnelly 2016: 91). It is a distinctive feature of the view that by positing for each relation a bespoke package of relative properties which models the logical character of the relation in question, _relative positonalism_ is able to handle relations of arbitrary complexity, including symmetric and partially symmetric relations (Donnelly 2016: 88–96, Dixon 2019: 56–67). By contrast, the _onto-thematic role_ approach doesn’t provide a once and for all recipe for positing roles but takes this to be a matter to be settled by systematic “ontological investigation” into the character of relations as we find them (Orilia 2014: 296–301 but see objections from MacBride 2014: 11–12, Ostertag 2019: 1492–5).

There are two immediate challenges faced by the different versions of _positionalism_. Can the account be generalized to cover all relations? If, for example, the binary symmetric relation that holds between two things aaa and bbb whenever aaa is next to bbb has two argument positions, £ and $, then there should be two possible ways of assigning aaa and bbb to £ and $. But this means (absurdly) that there are two different ways for aaa and bbb to be next to one another, _i.e._, symmetric relations admit of differential application too! Orilia’s _onto-thematic role_ approach handles this kind of case by conceiving of thematic roles as “intra-repeatable” (Orilia 2014: 294), so there is only one role or position in play in this relation (£ = $) and so the possibility of different assignments to different roles or positions doesn’t arise. Similarly, Dixon’s “pocket” theory handles this case by conceiving the _next to_ relation as having only one pocket. But, as Fine (2000: 17–18, 2007: 58–9) and MacBride (2007: 36–44) argue, and as Dixon (2018: 31, n.21) acknowledges, this kind of strategy doesn’t straightforwardly extend to more complex partially symmetric relations such as _being arranged clockwise in a circle in that very order_, or, _playing-tug-of-war_. Accordingly Orilia (2011: 6–9, 2014: 296–301) proposes a programme of analysis whereby more complex relations are reduced to simpler ones that the onto-thematic role approach can accommodate. By contrast, _relative positionalism_ can handle these kinds of partially symmetric relations without any analysis (Donnelly 2016: 88–96, Dixon 2019: 56–67), but not multigrade relations which lack a fixed arity _n_, hence cannot be modelled by a _n_! package of relative properties (Donnelly 2016: 94, Dixon 2019: 59) (For further criticisms of _positionalism_ see Hochberg 1999: 153, 2000: 40–1).

The more general challenge that faces the different versions of positionalism is whether we have a better understanding of positions and the assignment relation that the different versions of positionalism propose, than we do of the relations that positions and assignment are used to explain (Fine 2000: 16; MacBride 2014: 11–12; Orilia 2014: 302–3). Consider, for example, Donnelly’s claim that the application of _n_\-ary relations needs to be explained in terms of packages of _n_! relative properties. One problem, acknowledged by Donnelly (2016: 98), is the ontological cost of having to trade in each relation for so many properties. Another problem concerns why relative properties of a given package cannot be instantiated independently of one another but only relative to other properties belonging to that package, even though each relative property is meant to be unary. The obvious explanation is that such properties aren’t unary at all but to be explained in terms of an underlying relation (Bigelow & Pargetter 1990: 55, MacBride: 2000: 83). So saying that one thing _x_ has a property relative to something else _y_ having another relative property _etc_ is more perspicuously rendered by saying that _x_ bears a relation to _y_.

Both the standard view and the different versions of _positionalism_ assume that the differential application of a non-symmetric relation RRR with respect to aaa and bbb is to be explained “locally” in terms of RRR, whether its direction or argument positions, and the things it relates, aaa and bbb. _Anti-positionalism_ is the doctrine, due to Kit Fine, which eschews direction and argument positions and explains differential application by abandoning the assumption that differential application is to be explained locally (Fine 2000: 20–32). According to anti-positionalism, the difference between aRbaRba\\Rel b and bRabRab\\Rel a arises from how these states are inter-connected with other states that arise from RRR holding of other relata. So order is not a feature of given state capable of being isolated, but only emerges over a totality of states to which RRR gives rise. What distinguishes aRbaRba\\Rel b from bRabRab\\Rel a is that inter-connectedness with other states such as cRdcRdc\\Rel d. Pay special attention to the relative arrangement of the schematic names in the following sentence. Whereas the state aRbaRba\\Rel b is a completion of RRR by a,ba,ba, b in the same manner as cRdcRdc\\Rel d is a completion of RRR by c,dc,dc, d, the state bRabRab\\Rel a isn’t. The state bRabRab\\Rel a is a completion of RRR by bbb, aaa in the same manner as cRdcRdc\\Rel d is a completion of RRR by c,dc,dc, d (Fine 2000: 21). However, Fine doesn’t take the notion of two states being put together “in the same manner” as primitive, but explains this in terms of a substitution relation. To say that a state sss is a completion of relation RRR by a1,a2…,ana1,a2…,ana\_1, a\_2 \\ldots, a\_n in the same manner as a state ttt is completion of RRR by b1,b2…,bnb1,b2…,bnb\_1, b\_2 \\ldots, b\_n is to say that sss is completion of RRR by a1,a2…,ana1,a2…,ana\_1, a\_2 \\ldots, a\_n that results from simultaneously substituting a1,a2…,ana1,a2…,ana\_1, a\_2 \\ldots, a\_n for b1b1b\_1, b2…,bn2…,bn\_2 \\ldots, b\_n in ttt (and _vice versa_) (Fine 2000: 25–6). Fine goes on to suggest that the notion of simultaneous substitution of many objects may be defined, under certain conditions, in terms of the single substitution of one object (Fine 2000: 26 n. 15). _Converses_ is avoided because the notion of direction, in terms of which the distinction between converse relations is drawn, is eschewed. This is because substitution is doing all the work.

Fine’s version of _anti-positionalism_ has certain limitations, including the assumption that states arising from a single relation have a unique composition and that substitution operates on objects rather than occurrences of objects. Leo (2013) provides a more fully developed version of _anti-positonalism_ that addresses these limitations from a more formal point of view. According to Leo, relational complexes are structured perspectives on states ‘out there’ in reality, relational complexes have occurrences of objects, and different complexes of the same relation may correspond to the same state. It is key to this approach that substitution is a primitive operation taking a complex and an assignment of objects to the occurrences of objects in the complex as input and returning another complex as output. For example, for the complex of Anthony’s loving Cleopatra, substituting Abelard for the occurrence of Anthony and Eloise for the occurrence of Cleopatra results in the complex of Abelard’s loving Eloise. Substitution is identified in terms of basic principles governing substitutions, in particular a composition principle, which forms the heart of an antipositional theory of relations (Leo 2013: 363; for further developments and defence of this version of _anti-positionalism_, see Leo 2008a, 2008b, 2010, 2014, 2016).

By abandoning the assumption that differential application is to be explained locally, _anti-positionalism_ in effect tells us that we’re misconceiving the logical form of our ordinary relational judgements. Contrary to their surface form, relational judgements always have a suppressed argument position for other states, by which means the state we are making a judgement about is implicitly compared to another. The following two objections arise (MacBride 2007: 47–53). First of all, _anti-positionalism_ presupposes a non-symmetric relation of substitution to explain differential application. But this suggests that the explanation anti-positonalism provides involves a circularity because it uses a non-symmetric relation, substitution, whose differential application is take for granted. Take the state aRbaRba\\Rel b. The result of substituting aaa for bbb is the state aRaaRaa\\Rel a; where the result of substituting bbb for aaa is the state bRbbRbb\\Rel b. The outcomes are different so the substitution relation must be order sensitive. Secondly, anti-positionalism entails that there cannot be lonely binary relations, i.e., relations which only hold of exactly two things. But _prima facie_ we should be able to distinguish aRbaRba\\Rel b from bRabRab\\Rel a even if RRR holds between nothing except aaa and bbb, Antony’s loving Cleopatra from Cleopatra’s loving Antony even if the world is otherwise loveless (see, for replies to these objections, Fine 2007: 59–62, Wieland 2010: 487–93, Leo 2014: 279–81).

The third strategy, _primitivism_, seeks to avoid the difficulties that threaten _positionalism_ and _anti-positionalism_ by taking the radical step of asking us to reconfigure our explanatory settings. It’s a familiar thought that we cannot account for the fact that one thing bears a relation RRR to another by appealing to a further relation R′R′R' relating RRR to them—that way Bradley’s regress beckons. To avoid the regress we must recognise that a relation is not related to the things it relates, however language may mislead us to think otherwise. We simply have to accept as primitive, in the sense that it cannot be further explained, the fact that one thing bears a relation to another. But, according to primitivism, it is not only the fact _that_ one thing bears a (non-symmetric) relation RRR to another that needs to be recognised as ultimate and irreducible. _How_ RRR applies, whether the aRbaRba\\Rel b way or the bRabRab\\Rel a way, needs to be taken as primitive too (MacBride 2014: 14–15). The difficulties encountered by attempts to provide an analysis of differential application provide corroborative evidence for primitivism. Does refraining from providing an analysis of differential application constitute shirking an obligatory task for systematic philosophy? Hardly. Remember what Lewis correctly said about predication: “Not every _account_ is an _analysis_” (Lewis 1983: 352). What we need, according to this third strategy, is a form of realism committed to the existence of relations but which denies that the manner of their application, their differential application, can be further explained.

One of the most intriguing features of the debate about relations and differential application is that there is no single sense in which the different views we have considered seek to “explain” or “account” for differential application. They all run on different explanatory settings. Some think there is a genuine problem to do with the capacity of relations to differentially apply which needs to be explained by any successful theory of relations. Hence, because he thinks there is a genuine problem here, Hochberg claims that the question which any adequate theory of relations must answer “is about how the order is ontologically grounded in facts” (Hochberg 2001: 178). But others think that there isn’t a problem of differential application at all, much less one that requires an ontological analysis of relations or facts. This means that the debate cannot be reduced to simply an exchange of opinions about which view explains the most at the least cost.

For example, positionalists typically maintain that their positing roles, slots, pockets and relative properties enables them to answer what they take to be obligatory questions about why each relation applies the way it can and why some relations are capable of applying differently from the ways others can (Dixon 2019: 68). So the different ways that the relations _between_ and _adjacency_ are capable of applying is explained by positionalists in terms of the different ontological structures attributed to these relations, _i.e._ their number of roles or positions and the nature of the relation that assigns things to roles or positions. By contrast, anti-positionalists and primitivists deny that such questions about why relations have the capacity to differentially apply need answering at all. As Fine describes his own version of _anti-positionalism_, “It is a fundamental fact for \[the anti-positionalist\] that relations are capable of giving rise to a diversity of completions in application to any given relata and there is no explanation of this diversity in terms of a difference in the way the completions are formed from the relation and its relata” (Fine 2000: 19).

However, the explanatory differences between the parties to the debate run deeper than merely whether they think the capacity of relations to differentially apply is open to informative explanation. Whilst Fine takes the capacity of relations to differentially apply as primitive, Fine also holds that it is necessary to provide an account of wherein the difference consists between two states which arise from the same constituents: “Yet clearly the state of Anthony’s loving Cleopatra and the state of Cleopatra’s loving Anthony are distinguishable; they are not merely two indiscernible ”atoms“ within the space of states. But if these states are not to be distinguished by how they derive from the given relation and its relata, then how are they to be distinguished?”(Fine 2000: 20). Fine’s answer, as we have seen, is spelled out in terms of substitution. But Leo’s version of anti-positionalism has different explanatory settings again. He doesn’t engage with metaphysical questions about wherein the difference between states consists and instead provides principles of substitution intended to explicate rather than explain the differential application of relations (Leo 2013: 361–8). And primitivism, we have seen, takes the fact that relations admit of differential application as unanalysable too but also takes the difference between states arising from the same constituents as primitive (MacBride 2014: 8, _cf._ van Fraassen 1982). The dispute about relations and differential application continues because it remains to be established which questions about relations are genuine and which are pseudo-problems.

In conclusion, it should be emphasised that nothing written here is intended to imply that there is just one problem of order (differential application). It’s plausible that there are several problems in the vicinity, whether logical, metaphysical or epistemological and they will require different if co-ordinated solutions.
