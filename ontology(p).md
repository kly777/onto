 Ontology is the philosophical study of being. It is traditionally understood as the subdiscipline of metaphysics focused on the most general features of reality. As one of the most fundamental concepts, being encompasses all of reality and every entity within it. To articulate the basic structure of being, ontology examines the commonalities among all things and investigates their classification into basic types, such as the categories of particulars and universals. Particulars are unique, non-repeatable entities, such as the person Socrates, whereas universals are general, repeatable entities, like the color green. Another distinction exists between concrete objects existing in space and time, such as a tree, and abstract objects existing outside space and time, like the number 7. Systems of categories aim to provide a comprehensive inventory of reality by employing categories such as substance, property, relation, state of affairs, and event.
本体论是对存在的哲学研究。传统上，它被理解为形而上学的一个分支学科，专注于现实的最普遍特征。作为最基本的概念之一，存在包括所有现实及其中的每个实体。为了阐明存在的基本结构，本体论考察了所有事物之间的共性，并研究了它们被分类为基本类型，例如特殊性和普遍性的类别。Particulars 是唯一的、不可重复的实体，例如苏格拉底这个人，而普遍性是一般的、可重复的实体，例如绿色。存在于空间和时间中的具体对象（如树）与存在于空间和时间之外的抽象对象（如数字 7）之间存在另一个区别。类别系统旨在通过采用物质、属性、关系、事态和事件等类别来提供现实的全面清单。

Ontologists disagree regarding which entities exist at the most basic level. Platonic realism asserts that universals have objective existence, while conceptualism maintains that universals exist only in the mind, and nominalism denies their existence altogether. Similar disputes pertain to mathematical objects, unobservable objects assumed by scientific theories, and moral facts. Materialism posits that fundamentally only matter exists, whereas dualism asserts that mind and matter are independent principles. According to some ontologists, objective answers to ontological questions do not exist, with perspectives shaped by differing linguistic practices.
本体论者对于哪些实体存在于最基本的层面上存在分歧。柏拉图现实主义断言普遍性具有客观存在，而概念主义则认为普遍性只存在于头脑中，而唯名论则完全否认它们的存在。类似的争论涉及数学对象、科学理论假设的不可观察对象和道德事实。唯物主义认为从根本上说只有物质存在，而二元论则认为心灵和物质是独立的原则。根据一些本体论者的说法，本体论问题的客观答案并不存在，其观点是由不同的语言实践塑造的。

Ontology employs diverse methods of inquiry, including the analysis of concepts and experience, the use of intuitions and thought experiments, and the integration of findings from natural science. Formal ontology investigates the most abstract features of objects, while Applied ontology utilizes ontological theories and principles to study entities within specific domains. For example, social ontology examines basic concepts used in the social sciences. Applied ontology is particularly relevant to information and computer science, which develop conceptual frameworks of limited domains. These frameworks facilitate the structured storage of information, such as in a college database tracking academic activities. Ontology is also pertinent to the fields of logic, theology, and anthropology.
本体论采用多种探究方法，包括概念和经验的分析、直觉和思想实验的使用以及自然科学发现的整合。形式本体论研究对象最抽象的特征，而应用本体论利用本体论理论和原则来研究特定领域内的实体。例如，社会本体论研究社会科学中使用的基本概念。应用本体论与信息和计算机科学特别相关，它们开发了有限领域的概念框架。这些框架有助于信息的结构化存储，例如在跟踪学术活动的大学数据库中。本体论也与逻辑学、神学和人类学领域有关。

The origins of ontology lie in the ancient period with speculations about the nature of being and the source of the universe, including ancient Indian, Chinese, and Greek philosophy. In the modern period, philosophers conceived ontology as a distinct academic discipline and coined its name.
本体论的起源在于古代时期，对存在的本质和宇宙的源头进行了推测，包括古印度、中国和希腊哲学。在现代，哲学家将本体论视为一门独特的学科，并创造了它的名字。
Definition 定义

Ontology is the study of being. It is the branch of philosophy that investigates the nature of existence, the features all entities have in common, and how they are divided into basic categories of being.[1] It aims to discover the foundational building blocks of the world and characterize reality as a whole in its most general aspects.[a] In this regard, ontology contrasts with individual sciences like biology and astronomy, which restrict themselves to a limited domain of entities, such as living entities and celestial phenomena.[3] In some contexts, the term ontology refers not to the general study of being but to a specific ontological theory within this discipline. It can also mean an inventory or a conceptual scheme of a particular domain, such as the ontology of genes.[4] In this context, an inventory is a comprehensive list of elements.[5] A conceptual scheme is a framework of the key concepts and their relationships.[6]
本体论是对存在的研究。它是哲学的一个分支，研究存在的本质、所有实体的共同特征以及它们如何被划分为存在的基本类别。[1] 它旨在发现世界的基础组成部分，并从最一般的方面描述现实作为一个整体。[a] 在这方面，本体论与生物学和天文学等个别科学形成鲜明对比，后者将自己局限于有限的实体领域，例如生命实体和天体现象。[3] 在某些情况下，本体论一词不是指对存在的一般研究，而是指该学科中的特定本体论理论。它也可以表示特定域的清单或概念方案，例如基因的本体论。[4]在这种情况下，清单是元素的综合列表。[5] 概念方案是关键概念及其关系的框架。[6]

Ontology is closely related to metaphysics but the exact relation of these two disciplines is disputed. A traditionally influential characterization asserts that ontology is a subdiscipline of metaphysics. According to this view, metaphysics is the study of various aspects of fundamental reality, whereas ontology restricts itself to the most general features of reality.[7] This view sees ontology as general metaphysics, which is to be distinguished from special metaphysics focused on more specific subject matters, like God, mind, and value.[8] A different conception understands ontology as a preliminary discipline that provides a complete inventory of reality while metaphysics examines the features and structure of the entities in this inventory.[9] Another conception says that metaphysics is about real being while ontology examines possible being or the concept of being.[10] It is not universally accepted that there is a clear boundary between metaphysics and ontology. Some philosophers use both terms as synonyms.[11]
本体论与形而上学密切相关，但这两个学科的确切关系存在争议。一个传统上有影响力的描述断言，本体论是形而上学的一个分支学科。根据这种观点，形而上学是对基本现实各个方面的研究，而本体论将自己局限于现实的最普遍特征。[7] 这种观点将本体论视为一般的形而上学，这与专注于更具体主题的特殊形而上学区分开来，例如上帝、思想和价值。[8] 另一种概念将本体论理解为一门初步学科，它提供了对现实的完整清单，而形而上学则检查了该清单中实体的特征和结构。[9] 另一个概念说，形而上学是关于真实存在的，而本体论则研究可能的存在或存在的概念。[10] 形而上学和本体论之间有一个明确的界限，这一点并没有被普遍接受。一些哲学家将这两个术语用作同义词。[11]

The etymology of the word ontology traces back to the ancient Greek terms ὄντως (ontos, meaning 'being') and λογία (logia, meaning 'study of'), literally, 'the study of being'. The ancient Greeks did not use the term ontology, which was coined by philosophers in the 17th century.[12]
本体论一词的词源可以追溯到古希腊术语 ὄντως（本体，意思是“存在”）和 λογία（logia，意思是“研究”），字面意思是“对存在的研究”。古希腊人没有使用本体论一词，该术语是由哲学家在 17 世纪创造的。[12]

The scope of ontology covers diverse entities, including everyday objects, living beings, celestial bodies, ideas, numbers, and fictional creatures.

Being, or existence, is the main topic of ontology. It is one of the most general and fundamental concepts, encompassing all of reality and every entity within it.[b] In its broadest sense, being only contrasts with non-being or nothingness.[14] It is controversial whether a more substantial analysis of the concept or meaning of being is possible.[15] One proposal understands being as a property possessed by every entity.[16] Critics argue that a thing without being cannot have properties. This means that properties presuppose being and cannot explain it.[17] Another suggestion is that all beings share a set of essential features. According to the Eleatic principle, "power is the mark of being", meaning that only entities with causal influence truly exist.[18] A controversial proposal by philosopher George Berkeley suggests that all existence is mental. He expressed this immaterialism in his slogan "to be is to be perceived".[19]
存在或存在是本体论的主要主题。它是最普遍和最基本的概念之一，包括所有现实及其中的每个实体。[b] 从最广泛的意义上讲，存在只是与无或虚无形成对比。[14] 是否有可能对存在的概念或意义进行更实质性的分析是有争议的。[15] 一项提案将存在理解为每个实体所拥有的财产。[16]批评者认为，没有存在的事物不可能具有属性。这意味着属性以存在为前提，无法解释它。[17] 另一个建议是，所有生物都共享一组基本特征。根据 Eleatic 原则，“权力是存在的标志”，这意味着只有具有因果影响的实体才真正存在。[18]哲学家乔治·伯克利（George Berkeley）的一个有争议的提议表明，所有的存在都是精神的。他在他的口号“to be is to be tovided”中表达了这种非物质主义。[19]

Depending on the context, the term being is sometimes used with a more limited meaning to refer only to certain aspects of reality. In one sense, being is unchanging and permanent, in contrast to becoming, which implies change.[20] Another contrast is between being, as what truly exists, and phenomena, as what appears to exist.[21] In some contexts, being expresses the fact that something is while essence expresses its qualities or what it is like.[22]
根据上下文，“存在”一词有时具有更有限的含义，仅指代现实的某些方面。从某种意义上说，存在是不变的和永恒的，而成为则意味着变化。[20]另一个对比是作为真正存在之物的存在与作为表面存在之物的现象之间的对比。[21]在某些情况下，存在表达了某物是的事实，而本质表达了它的品质或它是什么样子。[22]

Ontologists often divide being into fundamental classes or highest kinds, called categories of being.[23] Proposed categories include substance, property, relation, state of affairs, and event.[24] They can be used to provide systems of categories, which offer a comprehensive inventory of reality in which every entity belongs to exactly one category.[23] Some philosophers, like Aristotle, say that entities belonging to different categories exist in distinct ways. Others, like John Duns Scotus, insist that there are no differences in the mode of being, meaning that everything exists in the same way.[25] A related dispute is whether some entities have a higher degree of being than others, an idea already found in Plato's work. The more common view in contemporary philosophy is that a thing either exists or not with no intermediary states or degrees.[26]
本体论者经常将存在分为基本类别或最高种类，称为存在类别。[23] 提议的类别包括物质、财产、关系、事态和事件。[24]它们可以用来提供类别系统，这些系统提供了现实的全面清单，其中每个实体都只属于一个类别。[23]一些哲学家，如亚里士多德，说属于不同类别的实体以不同的方式存在。其他人，如约翰·邓斯·斯科图斯（John Duns Scotus），坚持认为存在方式没有差异，这意味着一切都以相同的方式存在。[25]一个相关的争论是某些实体是否比其他实体具有更高的存在程度，这一想法在柏拉图的著作中已经出现。当代哲学中更普遍的观点是，一个事物要么存在，要么不存在，没有中介状态或度数。[26]

The relation between being and non-being is a frequent topic in ontology. Influential issues include the status of nonexistent objects[27] and why there is something rather than nothing.[28]
存在与非存在之间的关系是本体论中一个常见的话题。有影响力的问题包括不存在的对象的状态[27]以及为什么有东西而不是没有。[28]
Particulars and universals
特殊性和普遍性
Main articles: Particulars and Universals

Patch of green
The Taj Mahal is a particular entity while the color green is a universal entity.

A central distinction in ontology is between particular and universal entities. Particulars, also called individuals, are unique, non-repeatable entities, like Socrates, the Taj Mahal, and Mars.[29] Universals are general, repeatable entities, like the color green, the form circularity, and the virtue courage. Universals express aspects or features shared by particulars. For example, Mount Everest and Mount Fuji are particulars characterized by the universal mountain.[30]
本体论的一个主要区别是特殊实体和普遍实体。细节，也称为个体，是唯一的、不可重复的实体，如苏格拉底、泰姬陵和火星。[29] 普遍性是通用的、可重复的实体，就像绿色、形式循环和美德勇气一样。普遍性表达了细节所共有的方面或特征。例如，珠穆朗玛峰和富士山就是以万能山为特征的特殊性。[30]

Universals can take the form of properties or relations.[31][c] Properties describe the characteristics of things. They are features or qualities possessed by an entity.[33] Properties are often divided into essential and accidental properties. A property is essential if an entity must have it; it is accidental if the entity can exist without it.[34] For instance, having three sides is an essential property of a triangle, whereas being red is an accidental property.[35][d] Relations are ways how two or more entities stand to one another. Unlike properties, they apply to several entities and characterize them as a group.[37] For example, being a city is a property while being east of is a relation, as in "Kathmandu is a city" and "Kathmandu is east of New Delhi".[38] Relations are often divided into internal and external relations. Internal relations depend only on the properties of the objects they connect, like the relation of resemblance. External relations express characteristics that go beyond what the connected objects are like, such as spatial relations.[39]
通用性可以采用属性或关系的形式。[31][c] 属性描述了事物的特性。它们是实体所拥有的特征或品质。[33] 属性通常分为本质属性和偶然属性。如果实体必须拥有财产，则财产是必不可少的;如果实体可以在没有它的情况下存在，那是偶然的。[34]例如，拥有三条边是三角形的基本属性，而红色则是偶然属性。[35][d] 关系是两个或多个实体彼此站立的方式。与属性不同，它们适用于多个实体并将它们描述为一个组。[37]例如，作为一个城市是一种财产，而在东部是一种关系，如“加德满都是一个城市”和“加德满都在新德里以东”。[38]关系通常分为内部关系和外部关系。内部关系仅取决于它们所连接的对象的属性，例如相似性关系。外部关系表示超出所连接对象性质的特征，例如空间关系。[39]

Substances[e] play an important role in the history of ontology as the particular entities that underlie and support properties and relations. They are often considered the fundamental building blocks of reality that can exist on their own, while entities like properties and relations cannot exist without substances. Substances persist through changes as they acquire or lose properties. For example, when a tomato ripens, it loses the property green and acquires the property red.[41]
物质[e] 在本体论的历史中发挥着重要作用，是支撑属性和关系的基础和支持的特定实体。它们通常被认为是可以独立存在的现实的基本组成部分，而属性和关系等实体不能没有物质就存在。物质在获得或失去特性时会通过变化而存在。例如，当西红柿成熟时，它会失去 green 属性并获得 red 属性。[41]

States of affairs are complex particular entities that have several other entities as their components. The state of affairs "Socrates is wise" has two components: the individual Socrates and the property wise. States of affairs that correspond to reality are called facts.[42][f] Facts are truthmakers of statements, meaning that whether a statement is true or false depends on the underlying facts.[44]
事态是复杂的特定实体，它们具有多个其他实体作为其组成部分。“苏格拉底是明智的”状态有两个组成部分：个人苏格拉底和财产明智。与现实相对应的事态称为事实。[42][f] 事实是陈述的真理制造者，这意味着陈述是真是假取决于基本事实。[44]

Events are particular entities[g] that occur in time, like the fall of the Berlin Wall and the first moon landing. They usually involve some kind of change, like the lawn becoming dry. In some cases, no change occurs, like the lawn staying wet.[46] Complex events, also called processes, are composed of a sequence of events.[47]
事件是及时发生的特定实体[g]，例如柏林墙的倒塌和第一次登月。它们通常涉及某种变化，例如草坪变得干燥。在某些情况下，不会发生任何变化，例如草坪保持湿润。[46] 复杂事件，也称为流程，由一系列事件组成。[47]
Concrete and abstract objects
具体对象和抽象对象
Main article: Concrete and abstract

Concrete objects are entities that exist in space and time, such as a tree, a car, and a planet. They have causal powers and can affect each other, like when a car hits a tree and both are deformed in the process. Abstract objects, by contrast, are outside space and time, such as the number 7 and the set of integers. They lack causal powers and do not undergo changes.[48][h] The existence and nature of abstract objects remain subjects of philosophical debate.[50]
具体对象是存在于空间和时间中的实体，例如树、汽车和行星。它们具有因果力量并且可以相互影响，例如当汽车撞到树时，两者都在此过程中变形。相比之下，抽象对象位于空间和时间之外，例如数字 7 和整数集。他们缺乏因果力量，不会发生变化。[48][h] 抽象物体的存在和性质仍然是哲学辩论的主题。[50]

Concrete objects encountered in everyday life are complex entities composed of various parts. For example, a book is made up of two covers and the pages between them. Each of these components is itself constituted of smaller parts, like molecules, atoms, and elementary particles.[51] Mereology studies the relation between parts and wholes. One position in mereology says that every collection of entities forms a whole. According to another view, this is only the case for collections that fulfill certain requirements, for instance, that the entities in the collection touch one another.[52] The problem of material constitution asks whether or in what sense a whole should be considered a new object in addition to the collection of parts composing it.[53]
日常生活中遇到的具体物体是由各个部分组成的复杂实体。例如，一本书由两个封面和它们之间的页面组成。这些成分中的每一个本身都由较小的部分组成，如分子、原子和基本粒子。[51] 计量学研究部分和整体之间的关系。Mereology 中的一种立场是，每个实体集合都构成一个整体。根据另一种观点，这仅适用于满足某些要求的集合，例如，集合中的实体相互接触。[52]物质构成的问题是，除了构成一个整体的各部分的集合之外，是否或在何种意义上应该被视为一个新对象。[53]

Abstract objects are closely related to fictional and intentional objects. Fictional objects are entities invented in works of fiction. They can be things, like the One Ring in J. R. R. Tolkien's book series The Lord of the Rings, and people, like the Monkey King in the novel Journey to the West.[54] Some philosophers say that fictional objects are abstract objects and exist outside space and time. Others understand them as artifacts that are created as the works of fiction are written.[55] Intentional objects are entities that exist within mental states, like perceptions, beliefs, and desires. For example, if a person thinks about the Loch Ness Monster then the Loch Ness Monster is the intentional object of this thought. People can think about existing and non-existing objects. This makes it difficult to assess the ontological status of intentional objects.[56]
抽象对象与虚构和有意的对象密切相关。虚构对象是小说作品中虚构的实体。他们可以是事物，比如 J. R. R. Tolkien 的系列丛书《指环王》中的至尊魔戒，也可以是人，比如小说《西游记》中的孙悟空。[54]一些哲学家说，虚构的物体是抽象的物体，存在于空间和时间之外。其他人将它们理解为小说作品写作时创造的人工制品。[55] 意向对象是存在于心理状态中的实体，就像感知、信念和欲望一样。例如，如果一个人想到尼斯湖水怪，那么尼斯湖水怪就是这个想法的有意对象。人们可以考虑存在和不存在的对象。这使得评估意向对象的本体论状态变得困难。[56]
Other concepts 其他概念

Ontological dependence is a relation between entities. An entity depends ontologically on another entity if the first entity cannot exist without the second entity.[57] For instance, the surface of an apple cannot exist without the apple.[58] An entity is ontologically independent if it does not depend on anything else, meaning that it is fundamental and can exist on its own. Ontological dependence plays a central role in ontology and its attempt to describe reality on its most fundamental level.[59] It is closely related to metaphysical grounding, which is the relation between a ground and the facts it explains.[60]
本体论依赖是实体之间的关系。如果第一个实体不能在没有第二个实体的情况下存在，则一个实体在本体上依赖于另一个实体。[57]例如，没有苹果，苹果的表面就无法存在。[58] 如果一个实体不依赖于任何其他事物，那么它就是本体论独立的，这意味着它是基本的，可以独立存在。本体论依赖性在本体论及其试图在其最基本的层面上描述现实中起着核心作用。[59]它与形而上学的基础密切相关，形而上学的基础是基础和它所解释的事实之间的关系。[60]

Willard Van Orman Quine used the concept of ontological commitments to analyze theories.

An ontological commitment of a person or a theory is an entity that exists according to them.[61] For instance, a person who believes in God has an ontological commitment to God.[62] Ontological commitments can be used to analyze which ontologies people explicitly defend or implicitly assume. They play a central role in contemporary metaphysics when trying to decide between competing theories. For example, the Quine–Putnam indispensability argument defends mathematical Platonism, asserting that numbers exist because the best scientific theories are ontologically committed to numbers.[63]
一个人或一个理论的本体论承诺是根据它们存在的实体。[61] 例如，一个相信上帝的人对上帝有一种本体论的承诺。[62] 本体论承诺可以用来分析人们明确捍卫或隐含假设的本体论。当试图在相互竞争的理论之间做出决定时，它们在当代形而上学中发挥着核心作用。例如，奎因-普特南不可或缺性论点为数学柏拉图主义辩护，断言数字存在是因为最好的科学理论在本体论上致力于数字。[63]

Possibility and necessity are further topics in ontology. Possibility describes what can be the case, as in "it is possible that extraterrestrial life exists". Necessity describes what must be the case, as in "it is necessary that three plus two equals five". Possibility and necessity contrast with actuality, which describes what is the case, as in "Doha is the capital of Qatar". Ontologists often use the concept of possible worlds to analyze possibility and necessity.[64] A possible world is a complete and consistent way how things could have been.[65] For example, Haruki Murakami was born in 1949 in the actual world but there are possible worlds in which he was born at a different date. Using this idea, possible world semantics says that a sentence is possibly true if it is true in at least one possible world. A sentence is necessarily true if it is true in all possible worlds.[66]
可能性和必然性是本体论中的进一步主题。可能性描述了可能的情况，如“外星生命可能存在”。必要性描述了必须发生的事情，如“三加二等于五是必要的”。可能性和必要性与现实形成对比，现实描述了情况，如“多哈是卡塔尔的首都”。本体论经常使用可能世界的概念来分析可能性和必然性。[64] 一个可能的世界是事物本来可能的完整和一致的方式。[65]例如，村上春树出生于 1949 年，但有可能他在不同的世界出生。使用这个想法，可能的世界语义学说，如果一个句子在至少一个可能的世界里是真的，那么它可能是真的。如果一个句子在所有可能的世界中都是真的，那么它必然是真的。[66]

In ontology, identity means that two things are the same. Philosophers distinguish between qualitative and numerical identity. Two entities are qualitatively identical if they have exactly the same features, such as perfect identical twins. This is also called exact similarity and indiscernibility. Numerical identity, by contrast, means that there is only a single entity. For example, if Fatima is the mother of Leila and Hugo then Leila's mother is numerically identical to Hugo's mother.[67] Another distinction is between synchronic and diachronic identity. Synchronic identity relates an entity to itself at the same time. Diachronic identity relates an entity to itself at different times, as in "the woman who bore Leila three years ago is the same woman who bore Hugo this year".[68]
在本体论中，同一性意味着两件事是相同的。哲学家区分定性和数字同一性。如果两个实体具有完全相同的特征，例如完全相同的双胞胎，则它们在质量上是相同的。这也称为完全相似性和不可辨别性。相比之下，数字标识意味着只有一个实体。例如，如果法蒂玛是莱拉和雨果的母亲，那么莱拉的母亲在数量上与雨果的母亲相同。[67]另一个区别是共时和历时身份。共时身份同时将一个实体与自身联系起来。历时身份在不同的时间将一个实体与自身联系起来，如“三年前生下莱拉的女人就是今年生下雨果的同一个人”。[68]
Branches 分支

There are different and sometimes overlapping ways to divide ontology into branches. Pure ontology focuses on the most abstract topics associated with the concept and nature of being. It is not restricted to a specific domain of entities and studies existence and the structure of reality as a whole.[69] Pure ontology contrasts with applied ontology, also called domain ontology. Applied ontology examines the application of ontological theories and principles to specific disciplines and domains, often in the field of science.[70] It considers ontological problems in regard to specific entities such as matter, mind, numbers, God, and cultural artifacts.[71]
将本体划分为分支的方法不同，有时甚至是重叠的。纯粹本体论侧重于与存在的概念和本质相关的最抽象的主题。它不局限于实体的特定领域，而是研究存在和整个现实的结构。[69] 纯本体论与应用本体论（也称为领域本体论）形成对比。应用本体论考察本体论理论和原则在特定学科和领域的应用，通常是在科学领域。[70]它考虑了与物质、思想、数字、上帝和文化制品等特定实体有关的本体论问题。[71]

Social ontology, a major subfield of applied ontology, studies social kinds, like money, gender, society, and language. It aims to determine the nature and essential features of these concepts while also examining their mode of existence.[72] According to a common view, social kinds are useful constructions to describe the complexities of social life. This means that they are not pure fictions but, at the same time, lack the objective or mind-independent reality of natural phenomena like elementary particles, lions, and stars.[73] In the fields of computer science, information science, and knowledge representation, applied ontology is interested in the development of formal frameworks to encode and store information about a limited domain of entities in a structured way.[74] A related application in genetics is Gene Ontology, which is a comprehensive framework for the standardized representation of gene-related information across species and databases.[75]
社会本体论是应用本体论的一个主要子领域，研究社会类型，如金钱、性别、社会和语言。它旨在确定这些概念的性质和基本特征，同时也研究它们的存在方式。[72]根据一种普遍的观点，社会类型是描述社会生活复杂性的有用结构。这意味着它们不是纯粹的虚构，但同时缺乏自然现象（如基本粒子、狮子和星星）的客观或独立于思想的现实。[73] 在计算机科学、信息科学和知识表示领域，应用本体论对开发形式框架感兴趣，以结构化方式编码和存储有关有限实体域的信息。[74] 遗传学中的一个相关应用是基因本体论，它是一个跨物种和数据库标准化表示基因相关信息的综合框架。[75]

Formal ontology is the study of objects in general while focusing on their abstract structures and features. It divides objects into different categories based on the forms they exemplify. Formal ontologists often rely on the tools of formal logic to express their findings in an abstract and general manner.[76][i] Formal ontology contrasts with material ontology, which distinguishes between different areas of objects and examines the features characteristic of a specific area.[78] Examples are ideal spatial beings in the area of geometry and living beings in the area of biology.[79]
形式本体论是对对象的一般研究，同时关注其抽象结构和特征。它根据对象所体现的形式将对象分为不同的类别。形式本体论者经常依靠形式逻辑的工具以抽象和一般的方式表达他们的发现。[76][i] 形式本体论与物质本体论形成对比，物质本体论区分物体的不同区域并检查特定区域的特征。[78] 例子是几何学领域的理想空间生物和生物学领域的生物。[79]

Descriptive ontology aims to articulate the conceptual scheme underlying how people ordinarily think about the world. Prescriptive ontology departs from common conceptions of the structure of reality and seeks to formulate a new and better conceptualization.[80]
描述性本体论旨在阐明人们通常如何看待世界的概念方案。规定性本体论背离了对现实结构的常见概念，并寻求形成一种新的、更好的概念化。[80]

Another contrast is between analytic and speculative ontology. Analytic ontology examines the types and categories of being to determine what kinds of things could exist and what features they would have. Speculative ontology aims to determine which entities actually exist, for example, whether there are numbers or whether time is an illusion.[81]
另一个对比是分析本体论和思辨本体论之间的对比。分析本体论检查存在的类型和类别，以确定可能存在什么样的事物以及它们将具有哪些特征。思辨本体论旨在确定哪些实体实际存在，例如，是否存在数字或时间是否是一种幻觉。[81]
Martin Heidegger proposed fundamental ontology to study the meaning of being.

Metaontology studies the underlying concepts, assumptions, and methods of ontology. Unlike other forms of ontology, it does not ask "what exists" but "what does it mean for something to exist" and "how can people determine what exists".[82] It is closely related to fundamental ontology, an approach developed by philosopher Martin Heidegger that seeks to uncover the meaning of being.[83]
元本体论研究本体论的基本概念、假设和方法。与其他形式的本体论不同，它不问“什么存在”，而是“某物存在意味着什么”和“人们如何确定存在什么”。[82]它与基本本体论密切相关，这是哲学家马丁·海德格尔（Martin Heidegger）提出的一种方法，旨在揭示存在的意义。[83]
Schools of thought 思想流派
Realism and anti-realism
现实主义与反现实主义
Main articles: Philosophical realism and Anti-realism

The term realism is used for various theories[j] that affirm that some kind of phenomenon is real or has mind-independent existence. Ontological realism is the view that there are objective facts about what exists and what the nature and categories of being are. Ontological realists do not make claims about what those facts are, for example, whether elementary particles exist. They merely state that there are mind-independent facts that determine which ontological theories are true.[85] This idea is denied by ontological anti-realists, also called ontological deflationists, who say that there are no substantive facts one way or the other.[86] According to philosopher Rudolf Carnap, for example, ontological statements are relative to language and depend on the ontological framework of the speaker. This means that there are no framework-independent ontological facts since different frameworks provide different views while there is no objectively right or wrong framework.[87]
现实主义一词用于各种理论[j]，这些理论肯定某种现象是真实的或具有独立于心智的存在。本体论实在论认为存在什么以及存在的本质和类别存在客观事实。本体论实在论者不主张这些事实是什么，例如，基本粒子是否存在。他们只是陈述存在独立于心智的事实，这些事实决定了哪些本体论理论是正确的。[85]这个想法被本体论反现实主义者否认，他们也被称为本体论通货紧缩主义者，他们说无论如何都没有实质性的事实。[86]例如，根据哲学家鲁道夫·卡纳普（Rudolf Carnap）的说法，本体论陈述是相对于语言的，并取决于说话人的本体论框架。这意味着没有独立于框架的本体论事实，因为不同的框架提供了不同的观点，而客观上没有正确或错误的框架。[87]
Fresco showing Plato and Aristotle
Plato (left) and Aristotle (right) disagreed on whether universals can exist without matter.

In a more narrow sense, realism refers to the existence of certain types of entities.[88] Realists about universals say that universals have mind-independent existence. According to Platonic realists, universals exist not only independent of the mind but also independent of particular objects that exemplify them. This means that the universal red could exist by itself even if there were no red objects in the world. Aristotelian realism, also called moderate realism, rejects this idea and says that universals only exist as long as there are objects that exemplify them. Conceptualism, by contrast, is a form of anti-realism, stating that universals only exist in the mind as concepts that people use to understand and categorize the world. Nominalists defend a strong form of anti-realism by saying that universals have no existence. This means that the world is entirely composed of particular objects.[89]
从更狭义的意义上讲，现实主义是指某些类型的实体的存在。[88]关于普遍性的现实主义者说，普遍性具有独立于思想的存在。根据柏拉图现实主义者的说法，普遍性不仅独立于思想而存在，而且也独立于体现它们的特定对象。这意味着即使世界上没有红色物体，宇宙红色也可以自行存在。亚里士多德现实主义，也称为温和现实主义，拒绝这种观点，并表示普遍性只有在存在体现它们的对象时才存在。相比之下，概念主义是一种反现实主义的形式，它指出普遍性仅作为人们用来理解和分类世界的概念存在于头脑中。唯名论者通过说普遍性不存在来捍卫一种强烈的反现实主义形式。这意味着世界完全由特定对象组成。[89]

Mathematical realism, a closely related view in the philosophy of mathematics, says that mathematical facts exist independently of human language, thought, and practices and are discovered rather than invented. According to mathematical Platonism, this is the case because of the existence of mathematical objects, like numbers and sets. Mathematical Platonists say that mathematical objects are as real as physical objects, like atoms and stars, even though they are not accessible to empirical observation.[90] Influential forms of mathematical anti-realism include conventionalism, which says that mathematical theories are trivially true simply by how mathematical terms are defined, and game formalism, which understands mathematics not as a theory of reality but as a game governed by rules of string manipulation.[91]
数学实在论是数学哲学中一个密切相关的观点，它认为数学事实独立于人类的语言、思想和实践而存在，是被发现的，而不是发明的。根据数学柏拉图主义，之所以如此，是因为存在数学对象，如数字和集合。数学柏拉图主义者说，数学对象与原子和星星等物理对象一样真实，即使它们无法通过实证观察获得。[90]数学反现实主义的有影响力的形式包括约定俗成主义，它说数学理论仅仅通过数学术语的定义就微不足道地正确，以及游戏形式主义，它把数学理解为一种不受字符串操作规则支配的游戏，而不是现实理论。[91]

Modal realism is the theory that in addition to the actual world, there are countless possible worlds as real and concrete as the actual world. The primary difference is that the actual world is inhabited by us while other possible worlds are inhabited by our counterparts. Modal anti-realists reject this view and argue that possible worlds do not have concrete reality but exist in a different sense, for example, as abstract or fictional objects.[92]
模态现实主义是一种理论，即除了现实世界之外，还有无数与现实世界一样真实和具体的可能世界。主要区别在于，现实世界中居住着我们，而其他可能的世界则居住着我们的对应物。模态反现实主义者拒绝这种观点，并认为可能的世界没有具体的现实，而是以不同的意义存在，例如，作为抽象或虚构的对象。[92]

Scientific realists say that the scientific description of the world is an accurate representation of reality.[k] It is of particular relevance in regard to things that cannot be directly observed by humans but are assumed to exist by scientific theories, like electrons, forces, and laws of nature. Scientific anti-realism says that scientific theories are not descriptions of reality but instruments to predict observations and the outcomes of experiments.[94]
科学现实主义者说，对世界的科学描述是对现实的准确表示。[k] 它与人类无法直接观察到但被科学理论假设存在的事物（如电子、力和自然定律）特别相关。科学反现实主义说，科学理论不是对现实的描述，而是预测观察结果和实验结果的工具。[94]

Moral realists claim that there exist mind-independent moral facts. According to them, there are objective principles that determine which behavior is morally right. Moral anti-realists either claim that moral principles are subjective and differ between persons and cultures, a position known as moral relativism, or outright deny the existence of moral facts, a view referred to as moral nihilism.[95]
道德现实主义者声称存在独立于心智的道德事实。根据他们的说法，有一些客观原则决定了哪种行为在道德上是正确的。道德反现实主义者要么声称道德原则是主观的，并且因人和文化而异，这种立场被称为道德相对主义，要么直接否认道德事实的存在，这种观点被称为道德虚无主义。[95]
By number of categories
按类别数量

Monocategorical theories say that there is only one fundamental category, meaning that every single entity belongs to the same universal class.[96] For example, some forms of nominalism state that only concrete particulars exist while some forms of bundle theory state that only properties exist.[97] Polycategorical theories, by contrast, hold that there is more than one basic category, meaning that entities are divided into two or more fundamental classes. They take the form of systems of categories, which list the highest genera of being to provide a comprehensive inventory of everything.[98]
[96] 例如，某些形式的唯名论指出仅存在具体细节，而某些形式的束理论则指出仅存在属性。[97]相比之下，多分类理论认为存在不止一个基本类别，这意味着实体分为两个或多个基本类别。它们采用类别系统的形式，其中列出了最高的属，以提供所有内容的全面清单。[98]

The closely related discussion between monism and dualism is about the most fundamental types that make up reality. According to monism, there is only one kind of thing or substance on the most basic level.[99] Materialism is an influential monist view; it says that everything is material. This means that mental phenomena, such as beliefs, emotions, and consciousness, either do not exist or exist as aspects of matter, like brain states. Idealists take the converse perspective, arguing that everything is mental. They may understand physical phenomena, like rocks, trees, and planets, as ideas or perceptions of conscious minds.[100] Neutral monism occupies a middle ground by saying that both mind and matter are derivative phenomena.[101] Dualists state that mind and matter exist as independent principles, either as distinct substances or different types of properties.[102] In a slightly different sense, monism contrasts with pluralism as a view not about the number of basic types but the number of entities. In this sense, monism is the controversial position that only a single all-encompassing entity exists in all of reality.[l] Pluralism is more commonly accepted and says that several distinct entities exist.[104]
一元论和二元论之间密切相关的讨论是关于构成现实的最基本类型。根据一元论，在最基本的层面上只有一种事物或物质。[99] 唯物主义是一种有影响力的一元论观点;它说一切都是物质的。这意味着心理现象，如信仰、情感和意识，要么不存在，要么作为物质的各个方面存在，就像大脑状态一样。理想主义者则持相反的观点，认为一切都是心理的。他们可能会将岩石、树木和行星等物理现象理解为有意识头脑的想法或感知。[100] 中性一元论占据了中间立场，认为心灵和物质都是衍生现象。[101]二元论者指出，心灵和物质作为独立的原则存在，要么是不同的物质，要么是不同类型的属性。[102] 在略有不同的意义上，一元论与多元论形成对比，多元论不是关于基本类型的数量，而是关于实体的数量。从这个意义上说，一元论是一个有争议的立场，即在所有现实中只存在一个包罗万象的实体。[l] 多元主义更被普遍接受，并表示存在几个不同的实体。[104]
By fundamental categories
按基本类别

The historically influential substance-attribute ontology is a polycategorical theory. It says that reality is at its most fundamental level made up of unanalyzable substances that are characterized by universals, such as the properties an individual substance has or relations that exist between substances.[105] The closely related to substratum theory says that each concrete object is made up of properties and a substratum. The difference is that the substratum is not characterized by properties: it is a featureless or bare particular that merely supports the properties.[106]
历史上有影响力的物质-属性本体论是一个多分类理论。它说，现实在最基本的层面上是由不可分析的物质组成的，这些物质具有普遍性，例如单个物质所具有的属性或物质之间存在的关系。[105]与底层理论密切相关的理论说，每个具体对象都由属性和底层组成。不同之处在于，底层不是以属性为特征的：它是一个无特征或裸露的特殊性，仅支持属性。[106]

Various alternative ontological theories have been proposed that deny the role of substances as the foundational building blocks of reality.[107] Stuff ontologies say that the world is not populated by distinct entities but by continuous stuff that fills space. This stuff may take various forms and is often conceived as infinitely divisible.[108][m] According to process ontology, processes or events are the fundamental entities. This view usually emphasizes that nothing in reality is static, meaning that being is dynamic and characterized by constant change.[110] Bundle theories state that there are no regular objects but only bundles of co-present properties. For example, a lemon may be understood as a bundle that includes the properties yellow, sour, and round. According to traditional bundle theory, the bundled properties are universals, meaning that the same property may belong to several different bundles. According to trope bundle theory, properties are particular entities that belong to a single bundle.[111]
已经提出了各种替代本体论理论，否认物质作为现实基础组成部分的作用。[107] 事物本体论说，世界不是由不同的实体填充的，而是由填充空间的连续事物填充的。这些东西可以采取多种形式，并且通常被认为是无限可分的。[108][m] 根据过程本体论，过程或事件是基本实体。这种观点通常强调现实中没有什么是静态的，这意味着存在是动态的，以不断变化的特征。[110] 束理论指出，没有规则的对象，而只有共存属性的束。例如，柠檬可以理解为包含属性 yellow、sour 和 round 的捆绑包。根据传统的束理论，捆绑属性是通用的，这意味着相同的属性可能属于几个不同的束。根据比喻束理论，属性是属于单个束的特定实体。[111]

Some ontologies focus not on distinct objects but on interrelatedness. According to relationalism, all of reality is relational at its most fundamental level.[112][n] Ontic structural realism agrees with this basic idea and focuses on how these relations form complex structures. Some structural realists state that there is nothing but relations, meaning that individual objects do not exist. Others say that individual objects exist but depend on the structures in which they participate.[114] Fact ontologies present a different approach by focusing on how entities belonging to different categories come together to constitute the world. Facts, also known as states of affairs, are complex entities; for example, the fact that the Earth is a planet consists of the particular object the Earth and the property being a planet. Fact ontologies state that facts are the fundamental constituents of reality, meaning that objects, properties, and relations cannot exist on their own and only form part of reality to the extent that they participate in facts.[115][o]
一些本体论不关注不同的对象，而是关注相互关联性。根据关系主义，所有现实在其最基本的层面上都是关系性的。[112][n] 本体结构实在论同意这一基本思想，并关注这些关系如何形成复杂的结构。一些结构现实主义者指出，除了关系之外什么都没有，这意味着单个对象不存在。其他人则说单个对象存在，但取决于它们参与的结构。[114] 事实本体论提出了一种不同的方法，它关注属于不同类别的实体如何聚集在一起构成世界。事实，也称为事态，是复杂的实体;例如，地球是一颗行星的事实由特定物体地球和作为行星的属性组成。事实本体论指出，事实是现实的基本组成部分，这意味着对象、属性和关系不能单独存在，只有在它们参与事实的范围内才能构成现实的一部分。[115][o]

In the history of philosophy, various ontological theories based on several fundamental categories have been proposed. One of the first theories of categories was suggested by Aristotle, whose system includes ten categories: substance, quantity, quality, relation, place, date, posture, state, action, and passion.[117] An early influential system of categories in Indian philosophy, first proposed in the Vaisheshika school, distinguishes between six categories: substance, quality, motion, universal, individuator, and inherence.[118] Immanuel Kant's transcendental idealism includes a system of twelve categories, which Kant saw as pure concepts of understanding. They are subdivided into four classes: quantity, quality, relation, and modality.[119] In more recent philosophy, theories of categories were developed by C. S. Peirce, Edmund Husserl, Samuel Alexander, Roderick Chisholm, and E. J. Lowe.[120]
在哲学史上，已经提出了基于几个基本类别的各种本体论理论。亚里士多德提出了最早的类别理论之一，他的系统包括十个类别：物质、数量、质量、关系、地点、日期、姿势、状态、行动和激情。[117]印度哲学中一个早期有影响力的范畴系统，首先在毗舍舍派中提出，区分了六个类别：物质、质量、运动、普遍、个体和内在。[118] 康德的先验唯心主义包括一个由十二个类别组成的系统，康德将其视为纯粹的理解概念。它们细分为四类：数量、质量、关系和模态。[119]在最近的哲学中，C.S.皮尔斯、埃德蒙·胡塞尔、塞缪尔·亚历山大、罗德里克·奇泽姆和E.J.洛发展了范畴理论。[120]

The dispute between constituent and relational ontologies[p] concerns the internal structure of concrete particular objects. Constituent ontologies say that objects have an internal structure with properties as their component parts. Bundle theories are an example of this position: they state that objects are bundles of properties. This view is rejected by relational ontologies, which say that objects have no internal structure, meaning that properties do not inhere in them but are externally related to them. According to one analogy, objects are like pin-cushions and properties are pins that can be stuck to objects and removed again without becoming a real part of objects. Relational ontologies are common in certain forms of nominalism that reject the existence of universal properties.[122]
构成本体论和关系本体论之间的争论[p] 涉及具体特定对象的内部结构。组成本体表示对象具有内部结构，其中属性作为其组成部分。束理论就是这种立场的一个例子：它们指出对象是属性的束。这种观点被关系本体论所拒绝，关系本体论认为对象没有内部结构，这意味着属性并不存在于其中，而是与它们有外部关系。根据一个类比，对象就像针垫，而属性是可以粘在对象上并再次移除而不会成为对象的真实部分的针脚。关系本体论在某些形式的唯名论中很常见，这些唯名论拒绝普遍属性的存在。[122]

Hierarchical ontologies state that the world is organized into levels. Entities on all levels are real but low-level entities are more fundamental than high-level entities. This means that they can exist without high-level entities while high-level entities cannot exist without low-level entities.[123] One hierarchical ontology says that elementary particles are more fundamental than the macroscopic objects they compose, like chairs and tables. Other hierarchical theories assert that substances are more fundamental than their properties and that nature is more fundamental than culture.[124] Flat ontologies, by contrast, deny that any entity has a privileged status, meaning that all entities exist on the same level. For them, the main question is only whether something exists rather than identifying the level at which it exists.[125][q]
分层本体论指出世界被组织成多个级别。所有级别的实体都是真实的，但低级实体比高级实体更基本。这意味着它们可以在没有高级实体的情况下存在，而高级实体不能在没有低级实体的情况下存在。[123]一种分层本体论说，基本粒子比它们组成的宏观物体（如椅子和桌子）更基本。其他等级理论断言，物质比其属性更基本，自然比文化更基本。[124]相比之下，平面本体否认任何实体都具有特权状态，这意味着所有实体都存在于同一级别。对他们来说，主要问题只是某物是否存在，而不是确定它存在的层次。[125][问]

The ontological theories of endurantism and perdurantism aim to explain how material objects persist through time. Endurantism is the view that material objects are three-dimensional entities that travel through time while being fully present in each moment. They remain the same even when they gain or lose properties as they change. Perdurantism is the view that material objects are four-dimensional entities that extend not just through space but also through time. This means that they are composed of temporal parts and, at any moment, only one part of them is present but not the others. According to perdurantists, change means that an earlier part exhibits different qualities than a later part. When a tree loses its leaves, for instance, there is an earlier temporal part with leaves and a later temporal part without leaves.[127]
Endurantism 和 Perdurantism 的本体论理论旨在解释物质对象如何随着时间的推移而持续存在。Endurantism 认为物质对象是穿越时间的三维实体，同时完全存在于每一刻。即使它们随着变化而获得或失去属性，它们也保持不变。Perdurantism 认为物质对象是四维实体，不仅贯穿空间，而且贯穿时间。这意味着它们由时间部分组成，并且在任何时候，它们只有一个部分存在，而其他部分不存在。根据 perdurantists 的说法，变化意味着早期的部分与后期部分表现出不同的品质。例如，当一棵树失去叶子时，有一个较早的时间部分有叶子，而较晚的时间部分没有叶子。[127]

Differential ontology is a poststructuralist approach interested in the relation between the concepts of identity and difference. It says that traditional ontology sees identity as the more basic term by first characterizing things in terms of their essential features and then elaborating differences based on this conception. Differential ontologists, by contrast, privilege difference and say that the identity of a thing is a secondary determination that depends on how this thing differs from other things.[128]
微分本体论是一种后结构主义方法，对同一性和差异概念之间的关系感兴趣。它说，传统的本体论将身份视为更基本的术语，首先根据事物的基本特征来描述事物，然后根据这个概念阐述差异。相比之下，微分本体论者对差异享有特权，并说一个事物的身份是一个次要决定，它取决于这个事物与其他事物有何不同。[128]

Object-oriented ontology belongs to the school of speculative realism and examines the nature and role of objects. It sees objects as the fundamental building blocks of reality. As a flat ontology, it denies that some entities have a more fundamental form of existence than others. It uses this idea to argue that objects exist independently of human thought and perception.[129]
面向对象的本体论属于思辨现实主义流派，研究对象的性质和作用。它将对象视为现实的基本构建块。作为一个平面本体论，它否认某些实体比其他实体具有更基本的存在形式。它使用这个想法来论证物体独立于人类的思想和感知而存在。[129]
Methods 方法

Methods of ontology are ways of conducting ontological inquiry and deciding between competing theories. There is no single standard method; the diverse approaches are studied by metaontology.[130]
本体论方法是进行本体论探究并在相互竞争的理论之间做出决定的方法。没有单一的标准方法;Metaontology 研究了不同的方法。[130]

Conceptual analysis is a method to understand ontological concepts and clarify their meaning.[131] It proceeds by analyzing their component parts and the necessary and sufficient conditions under which a concept applies to an entity.[132] This information can help ontologists decide whether a certain type of entity, such as numbers, exists.[133] Eidetic variation is a related method in phenomenological ontology that aims to identify the essential features of different types of objects. Phenomenologists start by imagining an example of the investigated type. They proceed by varying the imagined features to determine which ones cannot be changed, meaning they are essential.[134][r] The transcendental method begins with a simple observation that a certain entity exists. In the following step, it studies the ontological repercussions of this observation by examining how it is possible or which conditions are required for this entity to exist.[136]
概念分析是一种理解本体论概念并阐明其含义的方法。[131]它通过分析它们的组成部分以及概念适用于实体的必要和充分条件来继续进行。[132] 这些信息可以帮助本体论确定某种类型的实体（例如数字）是否存在。[133] Eidetic variation 是现象学本体论中的一种相关方法，旨在识别不同类型物体的基本特征。现象学家首先想象一个被研究类型的例子。他们通过改变想象中的特征来确定哪些特征无法更改，这意味着它们是必不可少的。[134][r] 先验方法从对某个实体存在的简单观察开始。在下一步中，它通过检查该实体如何存在或需要哪些条件来研究该观察的本体论影响。[136]

Another approach is based on intuitions in the form of non-inferential impressions about the correctness of general principles.[137] These principles can be used as the foundation on which an ontological system is built and expanded using deductive reasoning.[138] A further intuition-based method relies on thought experiments to evoke new intuitions. This happens by imagining a situation relevant to an ontological issue and then employing counterfactual thinking to assess the consequences of this situation.[139] For example, some ontologists examine the relation between mind and matter by imagining creatures identical to humans but without consciousness.[140]
另一种方法是基于直觉，以非推理印象的形式对一般原则的正确性产生影响。[137] 这些原则可以用作使用演绎推理构建和扩展本体论系统的基础。[138]另一种基于直觉的方法依靠思想实验来唤起新的直觉。这是通过想象一个与本体论问题相关的情境，然后采用反事实思维来评估这个情境的后果来实现的。[139]例如，一些本体论者通过想象与人类相同但没有意识的生物来研究心灵和物质之间的关系。[140]

Naturalistic methods rely on the insights of the natural sciences to determine what exists.[141] According to an influential approach by Willard Van Orman Quine, ontology can be conducted by analyzing[s] the ontological commitments of scientific theories. This method is based on the idea that scientific theories provide the most reliable description of reality and that their power can be harnessed by investigating the ontological assumptions underlying them.[143]
自然主义方法依靠自然科学的洞察力来确定存在的东西。[141] 根据威拉德·范·奥曼·奎因 （Willard Van Orman Quine） 的一个有影响力的方法，本体论可以通过分析科学理论的本体论承诺来进行。这种方法基于这样一种理念，即科学理论提供了对现实的最可靠描述，并且可以通过研究其背后的本体论假设来利用它们的力量。[143]
Portrait of William of Ockham
William of Ockham proposed Ockham's Razor, a principle to decide between competing theories.

Principles of theory choice offer guidelines for assessing the advantages and disadvantages of ontological theories rather than guiding their construction.[144] The principle of Ockham's Razor says that simple theories are preferable.[145] A theory can be simple in different respects, for example, by using very few basic types or by describing the world with a small number of fundamental entities.[146] Ontologists are also interested in the explanatory power of theories and give preference to theories that can explain many observations.[147] A further factor is how close a theory is to common sense. Some ontologists use this principle as an argument against theories that are very different from how ordinary people think about the issue.[148]
理论选择原则为评估本体论理论的优缺点提供了指导方针，而不是指导它们的构建。[144] 奥卡姆剃刀的原理说，简单的理论是可取的。[145]一个理论可以在不同的方面很简单，例如，通过使用很少的基本类型，或者通过用少量的基本实体来描述世界。[146] 本体论者也对理论的解释力感兴趣，并优先考虑可以解释许多观察结果的理论。[147]另一个因素是理论与常识的接近程度。一些本体论者用这个原则来反对那些与普通人对这个问题的看法截然不同的理论。[148]

In applied ontology, ontological engineering is the process of creating and refining conceptual models of specific domains.[149] Developing a new ontology from scratch involves various preparatory steps, such as delineating the scope of the domain one intends to model and specifying the purpose and use cases of the ontology. Once the foundational concepts within the area have been identified, ontology engineers proceed by defining them and characterizing the relations between them. This is usually done in a formal language to ensure precision and, in some cases, automatic computability. In the following review phase, the validity of the ontology is assessed using test data.[150] Various more specific instructions for how to carry out the different steps have been suggested. They include the Cyc method, Grüninger and Fox's methodology, and so-called METHONTOLOGY.[151] In some cases, it is feasible to adapt a pre-existing ontology to fit a specific domain and purpose rather than creating a new one from scratch.[152]
在应用本体论中，本体论工程是创建和完善特定领域概念模型的过程。[149] 从头开始开发新的本体涉及各种准备步骤，例如划定要建模的领域范围并指定本体的目的和用例。一旦确定了该领域内的基本概念，本体工程师就会继续定义它们并描述它们之间的关系。这通常以正式语言完成，以确保精度，在某些情况下，还可以确保自动可计算性。在接下来的审查阶段，使用测试数据评估本体的有效性。[150]对于如何执行不同的步骤，已经提出了各种更具体的说明。它们包括 Cyc 方法、Grüninger 和 Fox 方法以及所谓的 METHONTOLOGY。[151] 在某些情况下，调整预先存在的本体以适应特定的领域和目的，而不是从头开始创建一个新的本体是可行的。[152]
Related fields 相关领域

Ontology overlaps with many disciplines, including logic, the study of correct reasoning.[153] Ontologists often employ logical systems to express their insights, specifically in the field of formal ontology. Of particular interest to them is the existential quantifier ( ∃ {\displaystyle \exists }), which is used to express what exists. In first-order logic, for example, the formula ∃ x Dog ( x ) {\displaystyle \exists x{\text{Dog}}(x)} states that dogs exist.[154] Some philosophers study ontology by examining the structure of thought and language, saying that they reflect the structure of being.[155] Doubts about the accuracy of natural language have led some ontologists to seek a new formal language, termed ontologese, for a better representation of the fundamental structure of reality.[156]
本体论与许多学科重叠，包括逻辑学、正确推理的研究。undefined 本体论者经常使用逻辑系统来表达他们的见解，特别是在形式本体论领域。他们特别感兴趣的是存在量词 （ ∃ {\displaystyle \exists }），它用于表示存在的东西。例如，在一阶逻辑中，公式 ∃ x Dog ( x ) {\displaystyle \exists x{\text{Dog}}(x)} 表示狗存在。undefined 一些哲学家通过研究思想和语言的结构来研究本体论，说它们反映了存在的结构。undefined对自然语言准确性的怀疑导致一些本体论者寻求一种新的形式语言，称为本体论，以更好地表示现实的基本结构。undefined

Fundamental categories in the Suggested Upper Merged Ontology[157]

Ontologies are often used in information science to provide a conceptual scheme or inventory of a specific domain, making it possible to classify objects and formally represent information about them. This is of specific interest to computer science, which builds databases to store this information and defines computational processes to automatically transform and use it.[158] For instance, to encode and store information about clients and employees in a database, an organization may use an ontology with categories such as person, company, address, and name.[159] In some cases, it is necessary to exchange information belonging to different domains or to integrate databases using distinct ontologies. This can be achieved with the help of upper ontologies, which are not limited to one specific domain. They use general categories that apply to most or all domains, like Suggested Upper Merged Ontology and Basic Formal Ontology.[160]
本体论在信息科学中通常用于提供特定域的概念方案或清单，从而可以对对象进行分类并正式表示有关它们的信息。计算机科学对此特别感兴趣，计算机科学构建数据库来存储这些信息，并定义计算过程以自动转换和使用这些信息。[158]例如，要在数据库中编码和存储有关客户和员工的信息，组织可以使用具有人员、公司、地址和名称等类别的本体。[159]在某些情况下，有必要交换属于不同领域的信息或使用不同的本体集成数据库。这可以在上层本体的帮助下实现，上层本体不限于一个特定领域。它们使用适用于大多数或所有领域的一般类别，例如 Suggested Upper Merged Ontology 和 Basic Formal Ontology。[160]

Similar applications of ontology are found in various fields seeking to manage extensive information within a structured framework. Protein Ontology is a formal framework for the standardized representation of protein-related entities and their relationships.[161] Gene Ontology and Sequence Ontology serve a similar purpose in the field of genetics.[162] Environment Ontology is a knowledge representation focused on ecosystems and environmental processes.[163] Friend of a Friend provides a conceptual framework to represent relations between people and their interests and activities.[164]
本体的类似应用存在于寻求在结构化框架内管理大量信息的各个领域。蛋白质本体论是蛋白质相关实体及其关系的标准化表示的正式框架。[161] 基因本体论和序列本体论在遗传学领域起着类似的作用。[162] 环境本体论是一种专注于生态系统和环境过程的知识表示。[163] 《朋友的朋友》提供了一个概念框架来表示人与他们的兴趣和活动之间的关系。[164]

The topic of ontology has received increased attention in anthropology since the 1990s, sometimes termed the "ontological turn".[165] This type of inquiry is focused on how people from different cultures experience and understand the nature of being. Specific interest has been given to the ontological outlook of Indigenous people and how it differs from a Western perspective.[166] As an example of this contrast, it has been argued that various indigenous communities ascribe intentionality to non-human entities, like plants, forests, or rivers. This outlook is known as animism[167] and is also found in Native American ontologies, which emphasize the interconnectedness of all living entities and the importance of balance and harmony with nature.[168]
自 1990 年代以来，本体论这个话题在人类学中受到了越来越多的关注，有时被称为“本体论转向”。[165]这种类型的探究侧重于来自不同文化的人们如何体验和理解存在的本质。人们对土著人民的本体论观点以及它与西方观点的不同之处特别感兴趣。[166]作为这种对比的一个例子，有人认为，各种土著社区将意向性归因于非人类实体，如植物、森林或河流。这种观点被称为万物有灵论[167]，也存在于美洲原住民本体论中，这些本体论强调所有生命体的相互联系以及与自然平衡与和谐的重要性。[168]

Ontology is closely related to theology and its interest in the existence of God as an ultimate entity. The ontological argument, first proposed by Anselm of Canterbury, attempts to prove the existence of the divine. It defines God as the greatest conceivable being. From this definition it concludes that God must exist since God would not be the greatest conceivable being if God lacked existence.[169] Another overlap in the two disciplines is found in ontological theories that use God or an ultimate being as the foundational principle of reality. Heidegger criticized this approach, terming it ontotheology.[170]
本体论与神学及其对上帝作为一个终极实体的存在的兴趣密切相关。本体论论证首先由坎特伯雷的安瑟伦提出，试图证明神的存在。它将上帝定义为可以想象的最伟大的存在。从这个定义中得出结论，上帝必须存在，因为如果上帝不存在，上帝就不会是可以想象的最伟大的存在。[169]这两个学科的另一个重叠是在使用上帝或终极存在作为现实的基本原则的本体论理论中发现的。海德格尔批评了这种方法，称之为本体神学。[170]
