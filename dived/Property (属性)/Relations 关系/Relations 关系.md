The distinction between properties and relations can hardly be given in terms that do not ultimately presuppose it.[23]
属性和关系之间的区别很难用不最终预设它的术语来给出。[23]

Relations are true of several particulars, or shared amongst them. Thus the relation "... is taller than ..." holds "between" two individuals, who would occupy the two ellipses ('...'). Relations can be expressed by N-place predicates, where N is greater than 1.
关系在几个细节上是正确的，或者在它们之间是共享的。因此，关系“......比......”包含两个 “between” 两个个体，这两个个体将占据两个省略号 （'...'）。关系可以用 N 位谓词表示，其中 N 大于 1。

Relations should be distinguished from relational properties. For example, marriage is a relation since it is between two people, but being married to X is a relational property had by a certain person since it concerns only one person.[23]
关系应与关系属性区分开来。例如，婚姻是一种关系，因为它是两个人之间的关系，但与 X 结婚是某个人拥有的关系属性，因为它只涉及一个人。[23]

There are at least some apparent relational properties which are merely derived from non-relational (or 1-place) properties. For instance "A is heavier than B" is a relational predicate, but it is derived from the two non relational properties: the mass of A and the mass of B. Such relations are called external relations, as opposed to the more genuine internal relations.[24] Some philosophers believe that all relations are external, leading to a scepticism about relations in general, on the basis that external relations have no fundamental existence.[citation needed]
至少有一些明显的关系属性，它们仅仅是从非关系（或 1 位）属性派生而来的。例如，“A is heavyer than B”是一个关系谓词，但它是从两个非关系属性派生而来的：A 的质量和 B 的质量。这种关系被称为外部关系，而不是更真实的内部关系。[24]一些哲学家认为所有关系都是外部的，导致对一般关系持怀疑态度，因为外部关系没有基本存在。
