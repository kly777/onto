Impure properties are properties that, unlike pure properties, involve reference to a particular substance in their definition.[14] So, for example, being a wife is a pure property while being the wife of Socrates is an impure property due to the reference to the particular "Socrates".[15] Sometimes, the terms qualitative and non-qualitative are used instead of pure and impure.[16] Most but not all impure properties are extrinsic properties. This distinction is relevant for the principle of identity of indiscernibles, which states that two things are identical if they are indiscernible, i.e. if they share all their properties.[14] This principle is usually defined in terms of pure properties only. The reason for this is that impure properties are not relevant for similarity or discernibility but taking them into consideration nonetheless would result in the principle being trivially true.[14] Another application of this distinction concerns the problem of duplication, for example, in the Twin Earth thought experiment. It is usually held that duplication only involves qualitative identity but perfect duplicates can still differ concerning their non-qualitative or impure properties.[16]
不纯属性是指与纯属性不同，在其定义中涉及引用特定物质的属性。[14]因此，例如，成为妻子是一种纯粹的属性，而作为苏格拉底的妻子是一种不纯的属性，因为提到了特定的“苏格拉底”。[15] 有时，使用定性和非定性这两个术语来代替 pure 和 unpure。[16] 大多数但不是全部的不纯属性都是外在属性。这种区别与不可辨别物的同一性原则有关，该原则指出，如果两个事物是不可辨别的，即如果它们共享它们的所有属性，那么它们就是相同的。[14] 这个原则通常只根据纯属性来定义。这样做的原因是不纯属性与相似性或可辨别性无关，但尽管如此，考虑到它们将导致该原则微不足道。[14]这种区别的另一个应用涉及重复问题，例如，在双子地球的思想实验中。通常认为，重复只涉及定性同一性，但完美复制物在其非定性或不纯性质方面仍然可能有所不同。[16]
