内在和外在的
Main article: Intrinsic and extrinsic properties (philosophy)

An intrinsic property is a property that an object or a thing has of itself, independently of other things, including its context. An extrinsic (or relational) property is a property that depends on a thing's relationship with other things. The latter is sometimes also called an attribute, since the value of that property is given to the object via its relation with another object. For example, mass is a physical intrinsic property of any physical object, whereas weight is an extrinsic property that varies depending on the strength of the gravitational field in which the respective object is placed. Another example of a relational property is the name of a person (an attribute given by the person's parents).
内在属性是对象或事物本身具有的属性，独立于其他事物，包括其上下文。外在（或关系）属性是依赖于事物与其他事物的关系的属性。后者有时也称为属性，因为该属性的值是通过对象与另一个对象的关系赋予对象的。例如，质量是任何物理物体的物理内在属性，而重量是一种外在属性，它根据放置相应物体的引力场的强度而变化。关系属性的另一个示例是人员的姓名（由人员的父母指定的属性）。
