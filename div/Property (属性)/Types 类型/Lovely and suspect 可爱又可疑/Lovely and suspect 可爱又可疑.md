Daniel Dennett distinguishes between lovely properties (such as loveliness itself), which, although they require an observer to be recognised, exist latently in perceivable objects; and suspect properties which have no existence at all until attributed by an observer (such as being suspected of a crime).[17]
丹尼尔·丹尼特 （Daniel Dennett） 区分了可爱的属性（例如可爱本身），尽管它们需要观察者才能被识别，但它们潜伏在可感知的物体中;以及在观察者归因之前根本不存在的可疑属性（例如涉嫌犯罪）。[17]
