**柏拉图主义**主张属性是共相(universals)，可被不同对象实例化
**殊相论者**认为属性是殊质(tropes)，即个别的具体属性[^1]

At least since Plato, properties are viewed by numerous philosophers as universals, which are typically capable of being instantiated by different objects. Philosophers opposing this view regard properties as particulars, namely tropes.
至少从柏拉图开始，许多哲学家将属性视为普遍性，它们通常能够被不同的对象实例化。反对这种观点的哲学家将属性视为特殊性，即殊质/个别属性 (tropes) 。
