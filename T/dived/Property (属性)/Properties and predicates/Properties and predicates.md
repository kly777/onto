属性和谓词

The ontological fact that something has a property is typically represented in language by applying a predicate to a subject. However, taking any grammatical predicate whatsoever to be a property, or to have a corresponding property, leads to certain difficulties, such as Russell's paradox and the Grelling–Nelson paradox. Moreover, a real property can imply a host of true predicates: for instance, if X has the property of weighing more than 2 kilos, then the predicates "..weighs more than 1.9 kilos", "..weighs more than 1.8 kilos", etc., are all true of it. Other predicates, such as "is an individual", or "has some properties" are uninformative or vacuous. There is some resistance to regarding such so-called "Cambridge properties" as legitimate.[18] These properties in the widest sense are sometimes referred to as abundant properties. They are contrasted with sparse properties, which include only properties "responsible for the objective resemblances and causal powers of things".[19]
某物具有属性的本体论事实通常在语言中通过将谓词应用于主语来表示。然而，将任何语法谓词视为属性或具有相应的属性，都会导致某些困难，例如罗素悖论和 Grelling-Nelson 悖论。此外，实数属性可以暗示许多真谓词：例如，如果 X 具有重量超过 2 公斤的属性，则谓词“..重超过 1.9 公斤“， ”..重超过 1.8 公斤“等，都是如此。其他谓词，例如“is an individual”或“has some properties”，则没有信息量或空洞。对于将此类所谓的“剑桥房产”视为合法，存在一些阻力。[18]这些最广义的属性有时被称为丰度属性。它们与稀疏属性形成对比，稀疏属性仅包括 “负责事物的客观相似性和因果力量 ”的属性。[19]
